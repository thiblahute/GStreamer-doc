<h1 id="threads">Threads</h1>
<p>GStreamer is inherently multi-threaded, and is fully thread-safe. Most
threading internals are hidden from the application, which should make
application development easier. However, in some cases, applications may
want to have influence on some parts of those. GStreamer allows
applications to force the use of multiple threads over some parts of a
pipeline. See <a href="../../../#when-would-you-want-to-force-a-thread">When would you want to force a
thread?</a>.</p>
<p>GStreamer can also notify you when threads are created so that you can
configure things such as the thread priority or the threadpool to use.
See <a href="../../../#configuring-threads-in-gstreamer">Configuring Threads in
GStreamer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling-in-gstreamer">Scheduling in GStreamer</h2>
<p>Each element in the GStreamer pipeline decides how it is going to be
scheduled. Elements can choose if their pads are to be scheduled
push-based or pull-based. An element can, for example, choose to start a
thread to start pulling from the sink pad or/and start pushing on the
source pad. An element can also choose to use the upstream or downstream
thread for its data processing in push and pull mode respectively.
GStreamer does not pose any restrictions on how the element chooses to
be scheduled. See the Plugin Writer Guide for more details.</p>
<p>What will happen in any case is that some elements will start a thread
for their data processing, called the “streaming threads”. The streaming
threads, or <code>GstTask</code> objects, are created from a <code>GstTaskPool</code> when the
element needs to make a streaming thread. In the next section we see how
we can receive notifications of the tasks and pools.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-threads-in-gstreamer">Configuring Threads in GStreamer</h2>
<p>A STREAM_STATUS message is posted on the bus to inform you about the
status of the streaming threads. You will get the following information
from the message:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a new thread is about to be created, you will be notified of
this with a GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_CREATE type. It is then
possible to configure a <code>GstTaskPool</code> in the <code>GstTask</code>. The custom
taskpool will provide custom threads for the task to implement the
streaming threads.</p>
<p>This message needs to be handled synchronously if you want to
configure a custom taskpool. If you don't configure the taskpool on
the task when this message returns, the task will use its default
pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a thread is entered or left. This is the moment where you could
configure thread priorities. You also get a notification when a
thread is destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You get messages when the thread starts, pauses and stops. This
could be used to visualize the status of streaming threads in a gui
application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now look at some examples in the next sections.</p>
<h3 id="boost-priority-of-a-thread">Boost priority of a thread</h3>
<pre><code>        .----------.    .----------.
        | faksesrc |    | fakesink |
        |         src-&gt;sink        |
        '----------'    '----------'

</code></pre>
<p>Let's look at the simple pipeline above. We would like to boost the
priority of the streaming thread. It will be the fakesrc element that
starts the streaming thread for generating the fake data pushing them to
the peer fakesink. The flow for changing the priority would go like
this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When going from READY to PAUSED state, fakesrc will require a
streaming thread for pushing data into the fakesink. It will post a
STREAM_STATUS message indicating its requirement for a streaming
thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application will react to the STREAM_STATUS messages with a
sync bus handler. It will then configure a custom <code>GstTaskPool</code> on
the <code>GstTask</code> inside the message. The custom taskpool is responsible
for creating the threads. In this example we will make a thread with
a higher priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, since the sync message is called in the thread
context, you can use thread ENTER/LEAVE notifications to change the
priority or scheduling pollicy of the current thread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a first step we need to implement a custom <code>GstTaskPool</code> that we can
configure on the task. Below is the implementation of a <code>GstTaskPool</code>
subclass that uses pthreads to create a SCHED_RR real-time thread. Note
that creating real-time threads might require extra priveleges.</p>

<p>The important function to implement when writing an taskpool is the
“push” function. The implementation should start a thread that calls
the given function. More involved implementations might want to keep
some threads around in a pool because creating and destroying threads is
not always the fastest operation.</p>
<p>In a next step we need to actually configure the custom taskpool when
the fakesrc needs it. For this we intercept the STREAM_STATUS messages
with a sync handler.</p>

<p>Note that this program likely needs root permissions in order to create
real-time threads. When the thread can't be created, the state change
function will fail, which we catch in the application above.</p>
<p>When there are multiple threads in the pipeline, you will receive
multiple STREAM_STATUS messages. You should use the owner of the
message, which is likely the pad or the element that starts the thread,
to figure out what the function of this thread is in the context of the
application.</p>
<h2 id="when-would-you-want-to-force-a-thread">When would you want to force a thread?</h2>
<p>We have seen that threads are created by elements but it is also
possible to insert elements in the pipeline for the sole purpose of
forcing a new thread in the pipeline.</p>
<p>There are several reasons to force the use of threads. However, for
performance reasons, you never want to use one thread for every element
out there, since that will create some overhead. Let's now list some
situations where threads can be particularly useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data buffering, for example when dealing with network streams or
when recording data from a live stream such as a video or audio
card. Short hickups elsewhere in the pipeline will not cause data
loss. See also <a href="buffering.html#stream-buffering">Stream buffering</a> about network
buffering with queue2.</p>
<p><img src="images/thread-buffering.png" alt="Data buffering, from a networked source" title="fig:" id="data-buffering-from-a-networked-source"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synchronizing output devices, e.g. when playing a stream containing
both video and audio data. By using threads for both outputs, they
will run independently and their synchronization will be better.</p>
<p><img src="images/thread-synchronizing.png" alt="Synchronizing audio and video sinks" title="fig:" id="synchronizing-audio-and-video-sinks"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Above, we've mentioned the “queue” element several times now. A queue is
the thread boundary element through which you can force the use of
threads. It does so by using a classic provider/consumer model as
learned in threading classes at universities all around the world. By
doing this, it acts both as a means to make data throughput between
threads threadsafe, and it can also act as a buffer. Queues have several
<code>GObject</code> properties to be configured for specific uses. For example,
you can set lower and upper thresholds for the element. If there's less
data than the lower threshold (default: disabled), it will block output.
If there's more data than the upper threshold, it will block input or
(if configured to do so) drop data.</p>
<p>To use a queue (and therefore force the use of two distinct threads in
the pipeline), one can simply create a “queue” element and put this in
as part of the pipeline. GStreamer will take care of all threading
details internally.</p>
