This implies that clip must be in a GES.Layer for the operation to be possible. \nThis method supports clips playing at a different tempo than one second per second. For example splitting a clip with a GES.Effect pitch tempo four seconds after it starts will set the inpoint of the new clip to six seconds after that of the clip to split. For this the rate changing property must be registered using ges_effect_class_register_rate_property for the pitch plugin this is already done. \nParameters \nthe GES.Clip to split \na Number representing the timeline position at which to split \nThe newly created GES.Clip resulting from the splitting or null if the clip can t be split. \n"});
