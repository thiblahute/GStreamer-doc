The caller should free the sample with gst_sample_unref not introspectable when finished. If ANY caps are specified the information will be returned in the whatever format is currently used by the sink. This information can be retrieve from caps associated with the buffer. \nA convenience method for ges_pipeline_get_thumbnail which returns a buffer in bit RGB optionally scaled to the specified width and height. If is specified for either dimension it will be left at native size. You can retreive this information from the caps associated with the buffer. \nThe caller is responsible for unreffing the returned sample with gst_sample_unref not introspectable \nObtains a pointer to playsink s audio sink element that is used for displaying audio when the GES.Pipeline is in GES.PipelineFlags.prototype.full_preview \nThe caller is responsible for unreffing the returned element with Gst.Object.prototype.unref. \nObtains a pointer to playsink s video sink element that is used for displaying video when the GES.Pipeline is in GES.PipelineFlags.prototype.full_preview \nThe caller is responsible for unreffing the returned element with Gst.Object.prototype.unref. \nSets playsink s audio sink element that is used for displaying audio when the GES.Pipeline is in GES.PipelineFlags.prototype.full_preview \nSets playsink s video sink element that is used for displaying video when the GES.Pipeline is in GES.PipelineFlags.prototype.full_preview \nSaves the current frame to the specified location. \nSpecify where the pipeline shall be rendered and with what settings. \nA copy of profile and output_uri will be done internally the caller can safely free those values afterwards. \nThis method must be called before setting the pipeline mode to GES.PipelineFlags.prototype.render \nSets the timeline to use in this pipeline. \nThe reference to the timeline will be stolen by the pipeline. \n"});
