See the documentation of the property snapping_distance for more information. \nSearch the GES.Track corresponding to the given timeline s pad. \nReturns the list of GES.Track used by the Timeline. \nLoads the contents of URI into the given timeline. \nRemoves the layer from the timeline. The reference that the timeline holds on the layer will be dropped. If you wish to use the layer after calling this method you need to take a reference before calling. \nRemove the track from the timeline. The reference stolen when adding the track will be removed. If you wish to use the track after calling this function you must ensure that you have a reference to it. \nSaves the timeline to the given location \nSets the layer to the given auto_transition. See the documentation of the property auto_transition for more information. \nSets the snapping_distance of the timeline. See the documentation of the property snapping_distance for more information. \n"});
