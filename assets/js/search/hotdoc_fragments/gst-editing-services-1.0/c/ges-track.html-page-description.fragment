To avoid to provide such a function we advice you to use the ges_audio_track_new and ges_video_track_new constructor when possible. \nSets the given caps as the caps the track has to output. \nUpdates the restriction caps by modifying all the fields present in caps in the original restriction caps. If for example the current restriction caps are video x raw format I420 width and caps is video x raw format RGB the restriction caps will be updated to video x raw format RGB width \nModification happens for each structure in the new caps and one can add new fields or structures through that function. \n"});
