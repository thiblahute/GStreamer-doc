Subclasses can write them but should make sure to properly call g_object_notify. \nGESTimelineElement parent \nThe GESTimelineElement that controls the object \nguint32 priority \npriority of the object in the layer top priority \nGets properties of a child of self. \nIn general a copy is made of the property contents and the caller is responsible for freeing the memory by calling g_value_unset. \nGets a property of a GstElement contained in object. \nNote that ges_timeline_element_get_child_property is really intended for language bindings ges_timeline_element_get_child_properties is much more convenient for C programming. \nGets a property of a child of self. \nGets a property of a child of self. If there are various child elements that have the same property name you can distinguish them using the following syntax ClasseName property_name as property name. If you don t the corresponding property of the first element found will be set. \nReturns a copy of the name of self. Caller should g_free the return value after usage. \nReturns the parent of self. This function increases the refcount of the parent object so you should gst_object_unref it after usage. \nReturns the timeline of self. This function increases the refcount of the timeline so you should gst_object_unref it after usage. \nGets the toplevel GESTimelineElement controlling self \nGets all the TrackTypes self will interact with \nGets an array of GParamSpec for all configurable properties of the children of self. \nLooks up which element and pspec would be effected by the given name. If various contained elements have this property name you will get the first one unless you specify the class name in name. \nEdits self in ripple mode. It allows you to modify the duration of a self and move the following neighbours accordingly. This will change the overall timeline duration. \nEdits self in roll mode. It allows you to modify the duration of a self and trim basicly change the start inpoint in this case the following neighbours accordingly. This will not change the overall timeline duration. \nEdits self in roll mode. It allows you to modify the start and inpoint of a self and resize basicly change the duration in this case of the previous neighbours accordingly. This will not change the overall timeline duration. \nSets a property of a child of self. If there are various child elements that have the same property name you can distinguish them using the following syntax ClasseName property_name as property name. If you don t the corresponding property of the first element found will be set. \nSets a property of a child of self \nNote that ges_timeline_element_set_child_property is really intended for language bindings ges_timeline_element_set_child_properties is much more convenient for C programming. \nSets a property of a child of self. \nSets a property of a child of self. If there are various child elements that have the same property name you can distinguish them using the following syntax ClasseName property_name as property name. If you don t the corresponding property of the first element found will be set. \nSet the duration of the object \nNote that if the timeline snap distance property of the timeline containing self is set self will properly snap to its neighboors. \nSet the in point that is the moment at which the self will start outputting data from its contents. \nSet the maximun duration of the object \nSets the name of object or gives self a guaranteed unique name if name is NULL This function makes a copy of the provided name so the caller retains ownership of the name it sent. \nSets the parent of self to parent. The object s reference count will be incremented and any floating reference will be removed see gst_object_ref_sink \nSets the priority of the object within the containing layer \nSet the position of the object in its containing layer. \nNote that if the snapping distance property of the timeline containing self is set self will properly snap to the edges around start. \nSets the timeline of self to timeline. \nThe GESTimelineElement base class.
