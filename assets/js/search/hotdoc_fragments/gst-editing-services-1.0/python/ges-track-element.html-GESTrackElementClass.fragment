This vmethod can be used for example in the case where you want the name of a child property to be overriden A good example of where it is usefull is the GESTitleSource where we have a videotestsrc which has a foreground color property that is used in the TitleSource to set the background color of the title in that case this method has been overriden so that we tweak the name passed has parametter to rename background to foreground backend making our API understandable. Deprecated use GESTimelineElement.lookup_child instead \nGESTrackElementClass._ges_reserved \n"});
