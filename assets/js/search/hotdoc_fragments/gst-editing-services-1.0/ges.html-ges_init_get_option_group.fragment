The group is set up to use standard GOption callbacks so when using this group in combination with GOption parsing methods all argument parsing and initialization is automated. \nThis function is useful if you want to integrate GES with other libraries that use GOption see g_option_context_add_group \nIf you use this function you should make sure you initialise the GStreamer as one of the very first things in your program. That means you need to use gst_init_get_option_group and add it to the option context before using the ges_init_get_option_group result. \na pointer to GES s option group. \n"});
