GstNet.NtpClock implements a Gst.Clock that synchronizes its time to a remote NTPv4 server. \nA new clock is created with GstNet.NetClientClock.new or GstNet.NtpClock.new which takes the address and port of the remote time provider along with a name and an initial time. \nThis clock will poll the time provider and will update its calibration parameters based on the local and remote observations. \nThe round trip property limits the maximum round trip packets can take. \nVarious parameters of the clock can be configured with the parent Gst.Clock timeout window size and window threshold object properties. \nA GstNet.NetClientClock and GstNet.NtpClock is typically set on a Gst.Pipeline with Gst.Pipeline.use_clock. \nIf you set a Gst.Bus on the clock via the bus object property it will send GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT messages with an attached Gst.Structure containing statistics about clock accuracy and network traffic. \n"});
