This is required as PTP listens on ports and thus requires special privileges. Once this helper process is started the main process will synchronize to all PTP domains that are detected on the selected interfaces. \nGstNet.PtpClock.new then allows to create a GstClock that provides the PTP time from a master clock inside a specific PTP domain. This clock will only return valid timestamps once the timestamps in the PTP domain are known. To check this you can use Gst.Clock.wait_for_sync the GstClock synced signal and Gst.Clock.is_synced. \nTo gather statistics about the PTP clock synchronization GstNet.ptp_statistics_callback_add can be used. This gives the application the possibility to collect all kinds of statistics from the clock synchronization. \n"});
