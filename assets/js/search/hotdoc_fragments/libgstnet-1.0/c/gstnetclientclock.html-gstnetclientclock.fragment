GstNtpClock implements a GstClock that synchronizes its time to a remote NTPv4 server. \nA new clock is created with gst_net_client_clock_new or gst_ntp_clock_new which takes the address and port of the remote time provider along with a name and an initial time. \nThis clock will poll the time provider and will update its calibration parameters based on the local and remote observations. \nThe round trip property limits the maximum round trip packets can take. \nVarious parameters of the clock can be configured with the parent GstClock timeout window size and window threshold object properties. \nA GstNetClientClock and GstNtpClock is typically set on a GstPipeline with gst_pipeline_use_clock. \nIf you set a GstBus on the clock via the bus object property it will send GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT messages with an attached GstStructure containing statistics about clock accuracy and network traffic. \n"});
