This is required as PTP listens on ports and thus requires special privileges. Once this helper process is started the main process will synchronize to all PTP domains that are detected on the selected interfaces. \ngst_ptp_clock_new then allows to create a GstClock that provides the PTP time from a master clock inside a specific PTP domain. This clock will only return valid timestamps once the timestamps in the PTP domain are known. To check this you can use gst_clock_wait_for_sync the GstClock synced signal and gst_clock_is_synced. \nTo gather statistics about the PTP clock synchronization gst_ptp_statistics_callback_add can be used. This gives the application the possibility to collect all kinds of statistics from the clock synchronization. \n"});
