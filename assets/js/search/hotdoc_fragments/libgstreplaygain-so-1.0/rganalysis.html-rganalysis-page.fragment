The element is designed as a pass through filter that never modifies any data. As it receives an EOS event it finalizes the ongoing analysis and generates a tag list containing the results. It is sent downstream with a tag event and posted on the message bus with a tag message. The EOS event is forwarded as normal afterwards. Result tag lists at least contain the tags GST_TAG_TRACK_GAIN GST_TAG_TRACK_PEAK and GST_TAG_REFERENCE_LEVEL. \nBecause the generated metadata tags become available at the end of streams downstream muxer and encoder elements are normally unable to save them in their output since they generally save metadata in the file header. Therefore it is often necessary that applications read the results in a bus event handler for the tag message. Obtaining the values this way is always needed for album processing see num tracks property since the album gain and peak values need to be associated with all tracks of an album not just the last one. \n"});
