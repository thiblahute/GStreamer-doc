These will then be prepended to\nthe next input data.</p>\n<p>The element implements the properties and sink caps configuration as specified\nin the GstRawBaseParse documentation. The properties configuration can be\nmodified by using the sample-rate, num-channels, channel-positions, format,\nand pcm-format properties.</p>\n<p>Currently, this parser supports raw data in a-law, mu-law, or linear PCM format.</p>\n<p>To facilitate operation with the unalignedaudioparse element, rawaudioparse\nsupports the \"audio/x-unaligned-raw\" media type. This is treated identically to\n\"audio/x-raw\", except that it is used by source elements which do not guarantee\nthat the buffers they push out are timestamped and contain an integer amount of\nsamples (see the 411 bytes example above). By using a different media type, it\nis guaranteed that unalignedaudioparse is autoplugged, making sure that the\nautoplugged chain does not push unparsed content downstream. The source caps'\nmedia type with linear PCM data is always \"audio/x-raw\", even if the sink caps\nuse \"audio/x-unaligned-raw\".</p>\n<p>The channel-positions property can be used to set explicit position information\nfor each channel. If the array that is passed to this property does not match\nthe number of channels indicated by num-channels, then said number of channels\nis updated to the array length. If channel-positions is NULL, then the default\nGStreamer positioning is used. This property is also useful for swapping left\nand right in a stereo signal for example.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-pipelines\">Example pipelines</h2>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 souphttpsrc http://my-dlna-server/track.l16 \\\n    rawaudioparse ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! autoaudiosink\n</code></pre>\n<p>Receive L16 data from a DLNA server, parse and timestamp it with\nrawaudioparse, and play it. use-sink-caps is set to true since souphttpsrc\nwill set its source pad's caps to audio/x-unaligned-raw for the L16 stream.</p>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=audio.raw ! rawaudioparse use-sink-caps=false \\\n        format=pcm pcm-format=s16le sample-rate=48000 num-channels=2 \\\n        audioconvert ! audioresample ! autoaudiosink\n</code></pre>\n<p>Read raw data from a local file and parse it as PCM data with 48000 Hz sample\nrate, signed 16 bit integer samples, and 2 channels. use-sink-caps is set to\nfalse to ensure the property information is used and the parser does not expect\naudio/x-raw or audio/x-unaligned-raw caps.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
