This location can be specified using any protocol supported by\nthe GIO library or it's VFS backends. Common protocols are 'file', 'http',\n'ftp', or 'smb'.</p>\n<p>If an URI or GFile is not mounted giosrc will post a message of type\n<a href=\"../libgstreamer-doc-1.0/c/gstmessage.html#GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT\">GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT</a> with name \"not-mounted\" on the bus. The message\nalso contains the GFile and the corresponding URI.\nApplications can use the \"not-mounted\" message to mount the GFile\nby calling g_file_mount_enclosing_volume and then restart the\npipeline after the mounting has succeeded. Note that right after the\n\"not-mounted\" message a normal error message is posted on the bus which\nshould be ignored if \"not-mounted\" is handled by the application, for\nexample by calling gst_bus_set_flushing(bus, TRUE) after the \"not-mounted\"\nmessage was received and gst_bus_set_flushing(bus, FALSE) after the\nmounting was successful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-launch-lines\">Example launch lines</h2>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 -v giosrc location=file:///home/joe/foo.xyz ! fakesink\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above pipeline will simply read a local file and do nothing with the\ndata read. Instead of giosrc, we could just as well have used the\nfilesrc element here.</p>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 -v giosrc location=smb://othercomputer/foo.xyz ! filesink location=/home/joe/foo.xyz\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above pipeline will copy a file from a remote host to the local file\nsystem using the Samba protocol.</p>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 -v giosrc location=smb://othercomputer/demo.mp3 ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! autoaudiosink\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above pipeline will read and decode and play an mp3 file from a\nSAMBA server.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
