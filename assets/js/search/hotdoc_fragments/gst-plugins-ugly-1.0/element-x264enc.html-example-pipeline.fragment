You should ideally never put H264 into an AVI container or really anything else for that matter use Matroska or MP4 QuickTime or MPEG TS instead. \nThis example pipeline will encode a test video source to H264 using fixed quantization and muxes it in a Matroska container. \nThis example pipeline will encode a test video source to H264 using constant quality at around Q25 using the medium speed quality preset and restricting the options used so that the output is H.264 Baseline Profile compliant and finally multiplexing the output in Quicktime mov format. \nThis example pipeline will encode a test video source to H264 while displaying the input material at the same time. As mentioned above specific settings are needed in this case to avoid pipeline stalling. Depending on goals and context other approaches are possible e.g. tune zerolatency might be configured or queue sizes increased. \n"});
