It can operate in one of two modes \nWith a recent enough version of libcdio the element will extract CD TEXT if this is supported by the CD drive and CD TEXT information is available on the CD. The information will be posted on the bus in form of a tag message. \nWhen opened the element will also calculate a CDDB disc ID and a MusicBrainz disc ID which applications can use to query online databases for artist title information. These disc IDs will also be posted on the bus as part of the tag messages. \ncdiocddasrc supports the GstUriHandler interface so applications can use playbin with cdda lt track number gt URIs for playback they will have to connect to playbin s notify source signal and set the device on the cd source in the notify callback if they want to set the device property Applications should use seeks in track format to switch between different tracks of the same CD passing a new cdda URI to playbin involves opening and closing the CD device which is much slower \n"});
