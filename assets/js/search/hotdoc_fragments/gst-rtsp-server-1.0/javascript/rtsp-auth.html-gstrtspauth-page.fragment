The default implementation has some reasonable checks but subclasses can implement custom security policies. \nA new auth object is made with GstRtspServer.RTSPAuth.prototype.new. It is usually configured on the GstRtspServer.RTSPServer object. \nThe RTSP server will call GstRtspServer.RTSPAuth.prototype.check with a string describing the check to perform. The possible checks are prefixed with GST_RTSP_AUTH_CHECK_ Depending on the check the default implementation will use the current GstRtspServer.RTSPToken GstRtspServer.RTSPContext and GstRtspServer.RTSPPermissions on the object to check if an operation is allowed. \nThe default GstRtspServer.RTSPAuth object has support for basic authentication. With GstRtspServer.RTSPAuth.prototype.add_basic you can add a basic authentication string together with the GstRtspServer.RTSPToken that will become active when successfully authenticated. \nWhen a TLS certificate has been set with GstRtspServer.RTSPAuth.prototype.set_tls_certificate the default auth object will require the client to connect with a TLS connection. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
