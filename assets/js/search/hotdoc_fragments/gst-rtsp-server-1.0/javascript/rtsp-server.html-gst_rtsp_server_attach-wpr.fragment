When the mainloop for context is run the server will be dispatched. When context is null the default context will be used \nThis function should be called when the server properties and urls are fully configured and the server is ready to start. \nThis takes a reference on server until the source is destroyed. Note that if context is not the default main context as returned by GLib.prototype.main_context_default or null GLib.prototype.source_remove cannot be used to destroy the source. In that case it is recommended to use GstRtspServer.RTSPServer.prototype.create_source and attach it to context manually. \nParameters \na GstRtspServer.RTSPServer \na GLib.MainContext \nthe ID greater than for the source within the GMainContext. \n"});
