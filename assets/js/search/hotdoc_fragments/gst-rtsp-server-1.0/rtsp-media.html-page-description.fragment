The actual data transfer is done by the GstRTSPStream objects that are created and exposed by the GstRTSPMedia. \nThe GstRTSPMedia is usually created from a GstRTSPMediaFactory when the client does a DESCRIBE or SETUP of a resource. \nA media is created with gst_rtsp_media_new that takes the element that will provide the streaming elements. For each of the streams a new GstRTSPStream object needs to be made with the gst_rtsp_media_create_stream which takes the payloader element and the source pad that produces the RTP stream. \nThe pipeline of the media is set to PAUSED with gst_rtsp_media_prepare. The prepare method will add rtpbin and sinks and sources to send and receive RTP and RTCP packets from the clients. Each stream srcpad is connected to an input into the internal rtpbin. \nIt is also possible to dynamically create GstRTSPStream objects during the prepare phase. With gst_rtsp_media_get_status you can check the status of the prepare phase. \nAfter the media is prepared it is ready for streaming. It will usually be managed in a session with gst_rtsp_session_manage_media. See GstRTSPSession and GstRTSPSessionMedia. \nThe state of the media can be controlled with gst_rtsp_media_set_state Seeking can be done with gst_rtsp_media_seek. \nWith gst_rtsp_media_unprepare the pipeline is stopped and shut down. When gst_rtsp_media_set_eos_shutdown an EOS will be sent to the pipeline to cleanly shut down. \nWith gst_rtsp_media_set_shared the media can be shared between multiple clients. With gst_rtsp_media_set_reusable you can control if the pipeline can be prepared again after an unprepare. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
