Use gst_rtsp_server_set_backlog to configure the amount of pending requests that the server will keep. By default the server listens on the current network and port \nThe server will require an SSL connection when a TLS certificate has been set in the auth object with gst_rtsp_auth_set_tls_certificate. \nTo start the server use gst_rtsp_server_attach to attach it to a GMainContext. For more control gst_rtsp_server_create_source and gst_rtsp_server_create_socket can be used to get a GSource and GSocket respectively. \ngst_rtsp_server_transfer_connection can be used to transfer an existing socket to the RTSP server for example from an HTTP server. \nOnce the server socket is attached to a mainloop it will start accepting connections. When a new connection is received a new GstRTSPClient object is created to handle the connection. The new client will be configured with the server GstRTSPAuth GstRTSPMountPoints GstRTSPSessionPool and GstRTSPThreadPool. \nThe server uses the configured GstRTSPThreadPool object to handle the remainder of the communication with this client. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
