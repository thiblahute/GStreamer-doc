The default implementation has some reasonable checks but subclasses can implement custom security policies. \nA new auth object is made with gst_rtsp_auth_new. It is usually configured on the GstRTSPServer object. \nThe RTSP server will call gst_rtsp_auth_check with a string describing the check to perform. The possible checks are prefixed with GST_RTSP_AUTH_CHECK_ Depending on the check the default implementation will use the current GstRTSPToken GstRTSPContext and GstRTSPPermissions on the object to check if an operation is allowed. \nThe default GstRTSPAuth object has support for basic authentication. With gst_rtsp_auth_add_basic you can add a basic authentication string together with the GstRTSPToken that will become active when successfully authenticated. \nWhen a TLS certificate has been set with gst_rtsp_auth_set_tls_certificate the default auth object will require the client to connect with a TLS connection. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
