It is created from a payloader element and a source pad that produce the RTP packets for the stream. \nWith gst_rtsp_stream_join_bin the streaming elements are added to the bin and rtpbin. gst_rtsp_stream_leave_bin removes the elements again. \nThe GstRTSPStream will use the configured addresspool as set with gst_rtsp_stream_set_address_pool to allocate multicast addresses for the stream. With gst_rtsp_stream_get_multicast_address you can get the configured address. \nWith gst_rtsp_stream_get_server_port you can get the port that the server will use to receive RTCP. This is the part that the clients will use to send RTCP to. \nWith gst_rtsp_stream_add_transport destinations can be added where the stream should be sent to. Use gst_rtsp_stream_remove_transport to remove the destination again. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
