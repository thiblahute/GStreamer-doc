It is usually manages by a GstRTSPSessionMedia object. \nWith gst_rtsp_stream_transport_set_callbacks callbacks can be configured to handle the RTP and RTCP packets from the stream for example when they need to be sent over TCP. \nWith gst_rtsp_stream_transport_set_active the transports are added and removed from the stream. \nA GstRTSPStream will call gst_rtsp_stream_transport_keep_alive when RTCP is received from the client. It will also call gst_rtsp_stream_transport_set_timed_out when a receiver has timed out. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
