It is used to allocate server ports and server multicast addresses but also to reserve client provided destination addresses. \nA range of addresses can be added with gst_rtsp_address_pool_add_range. Both multicast and unicast addresses can be added. \nWith gst_rtsp_address_pool_acquire_address an unused address and port range can be acquired from the pool. With gst_rtsp_address_pool_reserve_address a specific address can be retrieved. Both methods return a boxed GstRTSPAddress that should be freed with gst_rtsp_address_free after usage which brings the address back into the pool. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
