Currently the defined thread types can be found in GstRTSPThreadType. \nThreads of type GST_RTSP_THREAD_TYPE_CLIENT are used to handle requests from a connected client. With gst_rtsp_thread_pool_get_max_threads a maximum number of threads can be set after which the pool will start to reuse the same thread for multiple clients. \nThreads of type GST_RTSP_THREAD_TYPE_MEDIA will be used to perform the state changes of the media pipelines and handle its bus messages. \ngst_rtsp_thread_pool_get_thread can be used to create a GstRTSPThread object of the right type. The thread object contains a mainloop and context that run in a seperate thread and can be used to attached sources to. \ngst_rtsp_thread_reuse can be used to reuse a thread for multiple purposes. If all gst_rtsp_thread_reuse calls are matched with a gst_rtsp_thread_stop call the mainloop will be quit and the thread will stop. \nTo configure the threads a subclass of this object should be made and the virtual methods should be overriden to implement the desired functionality. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
