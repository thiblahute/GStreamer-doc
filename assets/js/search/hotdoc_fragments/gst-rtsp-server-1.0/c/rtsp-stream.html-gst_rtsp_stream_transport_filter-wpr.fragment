The result value of func determines what happens to the transport. func will be called with stream locked so no further actions on stream can be performed from func. \nIf func returns GST_RTSP_FILTER_REMOVE the transport will be removed from stream. \nIf func returns GST_RTSP_FILTER_KEEP the transport will remain in stream. \nIf func returns GST_RTSP_FILTER_REF the transport will remain in stream but will also be added with an additional ref to the result GList of this function.. \nWhen func is NULL GST_RTSP_FILTER_REF will be assumed for each transport. \nParameters \na GstRTSPStream \na callback \nuser data passed to func \na GList with all transports for which func returned GST_RTSP_FILTER_REF. After usage each element in the GList should be unreffed before the list is freed. \n"});
