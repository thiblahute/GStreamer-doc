It is created from a payloader element and a source pad that produce the RTP packets for the stream. \nWith GstRtspServer.RTSPStream.join_bin the streaming elements are added to the bin and rtpbin. GstRtspServer.RTSPStream.leave_bin removes the elements again. \nThe GstRtspServer.RTSPStream will use the configured addresspool as set with GstRtspServer.RTSPStream.set_address_pool to allocate multicast addresses for the stream. With GstRtspServer.RTSPStream.get_multicast_address you can get the configured address. \nWith gst_rtsp_stream_get_server_port you can get the port that the server will use to receive RTCP. This is the part that the clients will use to send RTCP to. \nWith GstRtspServer.RTSPStream.add_transport destinations can be added where the stream should be sent to. Use GstRtspServer.RTSPStream.remove_transport to remove the destination again. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
