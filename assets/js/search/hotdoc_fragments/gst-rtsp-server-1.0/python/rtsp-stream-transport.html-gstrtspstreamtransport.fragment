It is usually manages by a GstRtspServer.RTSPSessionMedia object. \nWith GstRtspServer.RTSPStreamTransport.set_callbacks callbacks can be configured to handle the RTP and RTCP packets from the stream for example when they need to be sent over TCP. \nWith GstRtspServer.RTSPStreamTransport.set_active the transports are added and removed from the stream. \nA GstRtspServer.RTSPStream will call GstRtspServer.RTSPStreamTransport.keep_alive when RTCP is received from the client. It will also call GstRtspServer.RTSPStreamTransport.set_timed_out when a receiver has timed out. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
