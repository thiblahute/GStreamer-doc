It is used to allocate server ports and server multicast addresses but also to reserve client provided destination addresses. \nA range of addresses can be added with GstRtspServer.RTSPAddressPool.add_range. Both multicast and unicast addresses can be added. \nWith GstRtspServer.RTSPAddressPool.acquire_address an unused address and port range can be acquired from the pool. With GstRtspServer.RTSPAddressPool.reserve_address a specific address can be retrieved. Both methods return a boxed GstRtspServer.RTSPAddress that should be freed with GstRtspServer.RTSPAddress.free after usage which brings the address back into the pool. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
