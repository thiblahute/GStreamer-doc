Currently the defined thread types can be found in GstRtspServer.RTSPThreadType. \nThreads of type GstRtspServer.RTSPThreadType are used to handle requests from a connected client. With GstRtspServer.RTSPThreadPool.get_max_threads a maximum number of threads can be set after which the pool will start to reuse the same thread for multiple clients. \nThreads of type GstRtspServer.RTSPThreadType will be used to perform the state changes of the media pipelines and handle its bus messages. \nGstRtspServer.RTSPThreadPool.get_thread can be used to create a GstRtspServer.RTSPThread object of the right type. The thread object contains a mainloop and context that run in a seperate thread and can be used to attached sources to. \nGstRtspServer.RTSPThread.reuse can be used to reuse a thread for multiple purposes. If all GstRtspServer.RTSPThread.reuse calls are matched with a GstRtspServer.RTSPThread.stop call the mainloop will be quit and the thread will stop. \nTo configure the threads a subclass of this object should be made and the virtual methods should be overriden to implement the desired functionality. \nLast reviewed on \n"});
