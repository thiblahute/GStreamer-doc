By default the element will try to negotiate to the same size on the source and sinkpad so that no scaling is needed. It is therefore safe to insert this element in a pipeline to get more robust behaviour without any cost if no scaling is needed. \nThis element supports a wide range of color spaces including various YUV and RGB formats and is therefore generally able to operate anywhere in a pipeline. \n"});
