This was the sample that caused the appsink to preroll in the PAUSED state. \nThis function is typically used when dealing with a pipeline in the PAUSED state. Calling this function after doing a seek will give the sample right after the seek position. \nCalling this function will clear the internal reference to the preroll buffer. \nNote that the preroll sample will also be returned as the first sample when calling GstApp.prototype.pull_sample or the pull sample action signal. \nIf an EOS event was received before any buffers this function returns null.
