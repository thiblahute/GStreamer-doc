Unlike most GStreamer elements Appsink provides external API functions. \nappsink can be used by linking to the gstappsink.h header file to access the methods or by using the appsink action signals and properties. \nThe normal way of retrieving samples from appsink is by using the GstApp.AppSink.prototype.pull_sample and GstApp.AppSink.prototype.pull_preroll methods. These methods block until a sample becomes available in the sink or when the sink is shut down or reaches EOS. There are also timed variants of these methods GstApp.AppSink.prototype.try_pull_sample and GstApp.AppSink.prototype.try_pull_preroll which accept a timeout parameter to limit the amount of time to wait. \nAppsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the streaming thread. If the application is not pulling samples fast enough this queue will consume a lot of memory over time. The max buffers property can be used to limit the queue size. The drop property controls whether the streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the maximum queue size is reached. Note that blocking the streaming thread can negatively affect real time performance and should be avoided. \nIf a blocking behaviour is not desirable setting the emit signals property to true will make appsink emit the new sample and new preroll signals when a sample can be pulled without blocking. \nThe caps property on appsink can be used to control the formats that appsink can receive. This property can contain non fixed caps the format of the pulled samples can be obtained by getting the sample caps. \nIf one of the pull preroll or pull sample methods return null the appsink is stopped or in the EOS state. You can check for the EOS state with the eos property or with the GstApp.AppSink.prototype.is_eos method. \nThe eos signal can also be used to be informed when the EOS state is reached to avoid polling. \n"});
