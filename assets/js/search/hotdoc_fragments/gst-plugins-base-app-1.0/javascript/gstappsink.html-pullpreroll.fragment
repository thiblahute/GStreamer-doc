This was the sample that caused the appsink to preroll in the PAUSED state. This sample can be pulled many times and remains available to the application even after EOS. \nThis function is typically used when dealing with a pipeline in the PAUSED state. Calling this function after doing a seek will give the sample right after the seek position. \nNote that the preroll sample will also be returned as the first sample when calling GstApp.AppSink.prototype.pull_sample or the pull sample action signal. \nIf an EOS event was received before any buffers this function returns null. Use gst_app_sink_is_eos to check for the EOS condition. \nThis function blocks until a preroll sample or EOS is received or the appsink element is set to the READY NULL state. \n"});
