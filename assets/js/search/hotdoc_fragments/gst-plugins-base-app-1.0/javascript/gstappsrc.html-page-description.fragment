A value of GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE means that the duration is not known. \nCheck if appsrc will emit the new preroll and new buffer signals. \nRetrieve the min and max latencies in min and max respectively. \nGet the maximum amount of bytes that can be queued in appsrc. \nGet the stream type. Control the stream type of appsrc with GstApp.AppSrc.prototype.set_stream_type. \nAdds a buffer to the queue of buffers that the appsrc element will push to its source pad. This function takes ownership of the buffer. \nWhen the block property is TRUE this function can block until free space becomes available in the queue. \nExtract a buffer from the provided sample and adds it to the queue of buffers that the appsrc element will push to its source pad. Any previous caps that were set on appsrc will be replaced by the caps associated with the sample if not equal. \nWhen the block property is TRUE this function can block until free space becomes available in the queue. \nSet the duration of the stream in nanoseconds. A value of GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE means that the duration is not known. \nMake appsrc emit the new preroll and new buffer signals. This option is by default disabled because signal emission is expensive and unneeded when the application prefers to operate in pull mode. \nConfigure the min and max latency in src. If min is set to the default latency calculations for pseudo live sources will be used. \nSet the maximum amount of bytes that can be queued in appsrc. After the maximum amount of bytes are queued appsrc will emit the enough data signal. \nSet the stream type on appsrc. For seekable streams the seek signal must be connected to. \nA stream_type stream \nThe stream is seekable and seeking is fast such as in a local file. \n"});
