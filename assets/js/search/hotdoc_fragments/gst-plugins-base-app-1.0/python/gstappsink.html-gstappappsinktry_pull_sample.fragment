All rendered buffers will be put in a queue so that the application can pull samples at its own rate. Note that when the application does not pull samples fast enough the queued buffers could consume a lot of memory especially when dealing with raw video frames. \nIf an EOS event was received before any buffers or the timeout expires this function returns None. Use gst_app_sink_is_eos to check for the EOS condition. \n"});
