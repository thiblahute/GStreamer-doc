This option is by default disabled because signal emission is expensive and unneeded when the application prefers to operate in pull mode. \nGet the last preroll sample in appsink. This was the sample that caused the appsink to preroll in the PAUSED state. This sample can be pulled many times and remains available to the application even after EOS. \nThis function is typically used when dealing with a pipeline in the PAUSED state. Calling this function after doing a seek will give the sample right after the seek position. \nNote that the preroll sample will also be returned as the first sample when calling gst_app_sink_pull_sample. \nIf an EOS event was received before any buffers or the timeout expires this function returns NULL. Use gst_app_sink_is_eos to check for the EOS condition. \nThis function blocks until a preroll sample or EOS is received the appsink element is set to the READY NULL state or the timeout expires. \ngpointer _gst_reserved \n"});
