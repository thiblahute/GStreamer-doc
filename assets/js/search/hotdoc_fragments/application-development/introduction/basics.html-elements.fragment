You will usually create a chain of elements linked together and let data flow through this chain of elements. An element has one specific function which can be the reading of data from a file decoding of this data or outputting this data to your sound card or anything else By chaining together several such elements you create a pipeline that can do a specific task for example media playback or capture. GStreamer ships with a large collection of elements by default making the development of a large variety of media applications possible. If needed you can also write new elements. That topic is explained in great deal in the GStreamer Plugin Writer s Guide. \n"});
