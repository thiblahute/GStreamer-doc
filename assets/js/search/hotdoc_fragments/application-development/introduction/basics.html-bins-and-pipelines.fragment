Since bins are subclasses of elements themselves you can mostly control a bin as if it were an element thereby abstracting away a lot of complexity for your application. You can for example change state on all elements in a bin by changing the state of that bin itself. Bins also forward bus messages from their contained children such as error messages tag messages or EOS messages \nA pipeline is a top level bin. It provides a bus for the application and manages the synchronization for its children. As you set it to PAUSED or PLAYING state data flow will start and media processing will take place. Once started pipelines will run in a separate thread until you stop them or the end of the data stream is reached. \n\n"});
