Data can travel the pipeline with minimal overhead. Data passing between plugins only involves a pointer dereference in a typical pipeline. \nproviding a mechanism to directly work on the target memory. A plugin can for example directly write to the X server s shared memory space. Buffers can also point to arbitrary memory such as a sound card s internal hardware buffer. \nrefcounting and copy on write minimize usage of memcpy. Sub buffers efficiently split buffers into manageable pieces. \ndedicated streaming threads with scheduling handled by the kernel. \nallowing hardware acceleration by using specialized plugins. \nusing a plugin registry with the specifications of the plugins so that the plugin loading can be delayed until the plugin is actually used. \n"});
