Many of the virtues of the GStreamer\nframework come from its modularity: GStreamer can seamlessly incorporate\nnew plugin modules. But because modularity and power often come at a\ncost of greater complexity, writing new applications is not always easy.</p>\n<p>This guide is intended to help you understand the GStreamer framework\nso you can develop applications based on it. The first\nchapters will focus on development of a simple audio player, with much\neffort going into helping you understand GStreamer concepts. Later\nchapters will go into more advanced topics related to media playback,\nbut also at other forms of media processing (capture, editing, etc.).</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<h3 id=\"who-should-read-this-manual\">Who should read this manual?</h3>\n<p>This book is about GStreamer from an application developer's point of\nview; it describes how to write a GStreamer application using the\nGStreamer libraries and tools. For an explanation about writing plugins,\nwe suggest the <a href=\"../plugin-development/index.html\">Plugin Writer's Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Also check out the other documentation available on the <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/\">GStreamer web\nsite</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"preliminary-reading\">Preliminary reading</h3>\n<p>In order to understand this manual, you need to have a basic\nunderstanding of the <em>C language</em>.</p>\n<p>Since GStreamer adheres to the GObject programming model, this guide\nalso assumes that you understand the basics of\n<a href=\"http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/\">GObject</a> and\n<a href=\"http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/stable/\">glib</a> programming.\nEspecially,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GObject instantiation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GObject properties (set/get)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GObject casting</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GObject referecing/dereferencing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>glib memory management</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>glib signals and callbacks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>glib main loop</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"structure-of-this-manual\">Structure of this manual</h3>\n<p>To help you navigate through this guide, it is divided into several\nlarge parts. Each part addresses a particular broad topic concerning\nGStreamer appliction development. The parts of this guide are laid out\nin the following order:</p>\n<p><a href=\"introduction/index.html\">About GStreamer</a> gives you an overview of GStreamer, its design\nprinciples and foundations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"basics/index.html\">Building an Application</a> covers the basics of GStreamer\napplication programming. At the end of this part, you should be able to\nbuild your own audio player using GStreamer</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"advanced/index.html\">Advanced GStreamer concepts</a>, we will move on to advanced\nsubjects which make GStreamer stand out of its competitors. We will discuss\napplication-pipeline interaction using dynamic parameters and interfaces, we\nwill discuss threading and threaded pipelines, scheduling and clocks (and\nsynchronization). Most of those topics are not just there to introduce you to\ntheir API, but primarily to give a deeper insight in solving application\nprogramming problems with GStreamer and understanding their concepts.</p>\n<p>Next, in <a href=\"highlevel/index.html\">Higher-level interfaces for GStreamer applications</a>, we\nwill go into higher-level programming APIs for GStreamer. You don't exactly\nneed to know all the details from the previous parts to understand this, but\nyou will need to understand basic GStreamer concepts nevertheless. We will,\namongst others, discuss playbin and autopluggers.</p>\n<p>Finally in <a href=\"appendix/index.html\">Appendices</a>, you will find some random\ninformation on integrating with GNOME, KDE, OS X or Windows, some\ndebugging help and general tips to improve and simplify GStreamer\nprogramming.</p>\n\n        \n\n    </div>\n\n\n        "});
