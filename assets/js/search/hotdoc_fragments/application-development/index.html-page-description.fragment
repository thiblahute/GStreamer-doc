Many of the virtues of the GStreamer framework come from its modularity GStreamer can seamlessly incorporate new plugin modules. But because modularity and power often come at a cost of greater complexity writing new applications is not always easy. \nThis guide is intended to help you understand the GStreamer framework so you can develop applications based on it. The first chapters will focus on development of a simple audio player with much effort going into helping you understand GStreamer concepts. Later chapters will go into more advanced topics related to media playback but also at other forms of media processing capture editing etc. \nThis book is about GStreamer from an application developer s point of view it describes how to write a GStreamer application using the GStreamer libraries and tools. For an explanation about writing plugins we suggest the Plugin Writer s Guide. \nAlso check out the other documentation available on the GStreamer web site. \nIn order to understand this manual you need to have a basic understanding of the C language. \nSince GStreamer adheres to the GObject programming model this guide also assumes that you understand the basics of GObject and glib programming. Especially \nGObject instantiation \nGObject properties set get \nGObject casting \nGObject referecing dereferencing \nglib memory management \nglib signals and callbacks \nglib main loop \nTo help you navigate through this guide it is divided into several large parts. Each part addresses a particular broad topic concerning GStreamer appliction development. The parts of this guide are laid out in the following order \nAbout GStreamer gives you an overview of GStreamer its design principles and foundations. \nBuilding an Application covers the basics of GStreamer application programming. At the end of this part you should be able to build your own audio player using GStreamer \nIn Advanced GStreamer concepts we will move on to advanced subjects which make GStreamer stand out of its competitors. We will discuss application pipeline interaction using dynamic parameters and interfaces we will discuss threading and threaded pipelines scheduling and clocks and synchronization Most of those topics are not just there to introduce you to their API but primarily to give a deeper insight in solving application programming problems with GStreamer and understanding their concepts. \nNext in Higher level interfaces for GStreamer applications we will go into higher level programming APIs for GStreamer. You don t exactly need to know all the details from the previous parts to understand this but you will need to understand basic GStreamer concepts nevertheless. We will amongst others discuss playbin and autopluggers. \nFinally in Appendices you will find some random information on integrating with GNOME KDE OS X or Windows some debugging help and general tips to improve and simplify GStreamer programming. \n"});
