Decodebin will in short accept input from a source that is linked to its sinkpad and will try to detect the media type contained in the stream and set up decoder routines for each of those. It will automatically select decoders. For each decoded stream it will emit the pad added signal to let the client know about the newly found decoded stream. For unknown streams which might be the whole stream it will emit the unknown type signal. The application is then responsible for reporting the error to the user. \nDecodebin similar to playbin supports the following features \nCan decode an unlimited number of contained streams to decoded output pads. \nIs handled as a GstElement in all ways including tag or error forwarding and state handling. \nAlthough decodebin is a good autoplugger there s a whole lot of things that it does not do and is not intended to do \nTaking care of input streams with a known media type e.g. a DVD an audio CD or such \nSelection of streams e.g. which audio track to play in case of multi language media streams \nOverlaying subtitles over a decoded video stream. \nDecodebin can be easily tested on the commandline e.g. by using the command gst launch filesrc location file.ogg decodebin audioconvert audioresample autoaudiosink. \n"});
