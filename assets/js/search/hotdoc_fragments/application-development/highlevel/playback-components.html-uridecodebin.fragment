The buffering element will post BUFFERING messages that the application needs to handle as explained in Buffering. The following properties can be used to configure the buffering method \nThe buffer size property allows you to configure a maximum size in bytes for the buffer element. \nThe buffer duration property allows you to configure a maximum size in time for the buffer element. The time will be estimated based on the bitrate of the network. \nWith the download property you can enable the download buffering method as described in Download buffering. Setting this option to TRUE will only enable download buffering for selected formats such as quicktime flash video avi and webm. \nYou can also enable buffering on the parsed demuxed data with the use buffering property. This is interesting to enable buffering on slower random access media such as a network file server. \nURIDecodebin can be easily tested on the commandline e.g. by using the command gst launch uridecodebin uri file file.ogg audioconvert audioresample autoaudiosink. \n"});
