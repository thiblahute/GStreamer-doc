It has request pads for raw decoded audio video and text and it will configure itself to play the media streams. It has the following features \nIt exposes GstStreamVolume GstVideoOverlay GstNavigation and GstColorBalance interfaces and automatically plugs software elements to implement the interfaces when needed. \nIt will automatically plug conversion elements. \nCan optionally render visualizations when there is no video input. \nConfigurable sink elements. \nConfigurable audio video sync offset to fine tune synchronization in badly muxed files. \nSupport for taking a snapshot of the last video frame. \nBelow is an example of how you can use playsink. We use a uridecodebin element to decode into raw audio and video streams which we then link to the playsink request pads. We only link the first audio and video pads you could use an input selector to link all pads. \nThis example will show audio and video depending on what you give it. Try this example on an audio file and you will see that it shows visualizations. You can change the visualization at runtime by changing the vis plugin property. \n"});
