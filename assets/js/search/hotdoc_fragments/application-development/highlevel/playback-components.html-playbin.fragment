For separate subtitle files use the suburi property. \nSupports stream selection and disabling. If your media has multiple audio or subtitle tracks you can dynamically choose which one to play back or decide to turn it off altogether which is especially useful to turn off subtitles For each of those use the current text and other related properties. \nFor convenience it is possible to test playbin on the commandline using the command gst launch playbin uri file path to file \n"});
