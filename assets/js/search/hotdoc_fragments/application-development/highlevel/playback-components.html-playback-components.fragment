All of the components discussed here for now are targetted at media playback. The idea of each of these components is to integrate as closely as possible with a GStreamer pipeline but to hide the complexity of media type detection and several other rather complex topics that have been discussed in Advanced GStreamer concepts. \nWe currently recommend people to use either playbin see Playbin or decodebin see Decodebin depending on their needs. Playbin is the recommended solution for everything related to simple playback of media that should just work. Decodebin is a more flexible autoplugger that could be used to add more advanced features such as playlist support crossfading of audio tracks and so on. Its programming interface is more low level than that of playbin though. \n"});
