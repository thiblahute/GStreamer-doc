A property consists of a key a string and a value. There are different possible value types that can be used \nBasic types this can be pretty much any GType registered with Glib. Those properties indicate a specific non dynamic value for this property. Examples include \nAn integer value G_TYPE_INT the property has this exact value. \nA boolean value G_TYPE_BOOLEAN the property is either TRUE or FALSE. \nA float value G_TYPE_FLOAT the property has this exact floating point value. \nA string value G_TYPE_STRING the property contains a UTF string. \nA fraction value GST_TYPE_FRACTION contains a fraction expressed by an integer numerator and denominator. \nRange types are GTypes registered by GStreamer to indicate a range of possible values. They are used for indicating allowed audio samplerate values or supported video sizes. The two types defined in GStreamer are \nAn integer range value GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE the property denotes a range of possible integers with a lower and an upper boundary. The vorbisdec element for example has a rate property that can be between and \nA float range value GST_TYPE_FLOAT_RANGE the property denotes a range of possible floating point values with a lower and an upper boundary. \nA fraction range value GST_TYPE_FRACTION_RANGE the property denotes a range of possible fraction values with a lower and an upper boundary. \nA list value GST_TYPE_LIST the property can take any value from a list of basic values given in this list. \nExample caps that express that either a sample rate of Hz and a sample rate of Hz is supported would use a list of integer values with one value being and one value being \nAn array value GST_TYPE_ARRAY the property is an array of values. Each value in the array is a full value on its own too. All values in the array should be of the same elementary type. This means that an array can contain any combination of integers lists of integers integer ranges together and the same for floats or strings but it can not contain both floats and ints at the same time. \nExample for audio where there are more than two channels involved the channel layout needs to be specified for one and two channel audio the channel layout is implicit unless stated otherwise in the caps So the channel layout would be an array of integer enum values where each enum value represents a loudspeaker position. Unlike a GST_TYPE_LIST the values in an array will be interpreted as a whole. \n"});
