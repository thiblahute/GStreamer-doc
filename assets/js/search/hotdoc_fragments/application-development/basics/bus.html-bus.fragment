fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "application-development/basics/bus.html#bus", "fragment": "Bus \nA bus is a simple system that takes care of forwarding messages from the streaming threads to an application in its own thread context. The advantage of a bus is that an application does not need to be thread aware in order to use GStreamer even though GStreamer itself is heavily threaded. \nEvery pipeline contains a bus by default so applications do not need to create a bus or anything. The only thing applications should do is set a message handler on a bus which is similar to a signal handler to an object. When the mainloop is running the bus will periodically be checked for new messages and the callback will be called when any message is available. \n"});
