This makes them very useful for various purposes \nAutoplugging automatically finding elements to link to a pad based on its capabilities. All autopluggers use this method. \nCompatibility detection when two pads are linked GStreamer can verify if the two pads are talking about the same media type. The process of linking two pads and checking if they are compatible is called caps negotiation \nMetadata by reading the capabilities from a pad applications can provide information about the type of media that is being streamed over the pad which is information about the stream that is currently being played back. \nFiltering an application can use capabilities to limit the possible media types that can stream between two pads to a specific subset of their supported stream types. An application can for example use filtered caps to set a specific fixed or non fixed video size that should stream between two pads. You will see an example of filtered caps later in this manual in Manually adding or removing data from to a pipeline. You can do caps filtering by inserting a capsfilter element into your pipeline and setting its caps property. Caps filters are often placed after converter elements like audioconvert audioresample videoconvert or videoscale to force those converters to convert data to a specific output format at a certain point in a stream. \n"});
