The sink pad of element one is now also a pad of the bin. Because ghost pads look and work like any other pads they can be added to any type of elements not just to a GstBin just like ordinary pads. \nA ghostpad is created using the function gst_ghost_pad_new \nIn the above example the bin now also has a pad the pad called sink of the given element. The bin can from here on be used as a substitute for the sink element. You could for example link another element to the bin. \n"});
