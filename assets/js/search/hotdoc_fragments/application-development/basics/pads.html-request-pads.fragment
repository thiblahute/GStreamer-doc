These pads are not created automatically but are only created on demand. This is very useful for multiplexers aggregators and tee elements. Aggregators are elements that merge the content of several input streams together into one output stream. Tee elements are the reverse they are elements that have one input stream and copy this stream to each of their output pads which are created on request. Whenever an application needs another copy of the stream it can simply request a new output pad from the tee element. \nThe following piece of code shows how you can request a new output pad from a tee element \nThe gst_element_get_request_pad method can be used to get a pad from the element based on the name of the pad template. It is also possible to request a pad that is compatible with another pad template. This is very useful if you want to link an element to a multiplexer element and you need to request a pad that is compatible. The method gst_element_get_compatible_pad can be used to request a compatible pad as shown in the next example. It will request a compatible pad from an Ogg multiplexer from any input. \n"});
