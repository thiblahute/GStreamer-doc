The name of the element is something you can use later on to look up the element in a bin for example. The name will also be used in debug output. You can pass NULL as the name argument to get a unique default name. \nWhen you don t need the element anymore you need to unref it using gst_object_unref This decreases the reference count for the element by An element has a refcount of when it gets created. An element gets destroyed completely when the refcount is decreased to \nThe following example shows how to create an element named source from the element factory named fakesrc. It checks if the creation succeeded. After checking it unrefs the element. \ngst_element_factory_make is actually a shorthand for a combination of two functions. A GstElement object is created from a factory. To create the element you have to get access to a GstElementFactory object using a unique factory name. This is done with gst_element_factory_find \nThe following code fragment is used to get a factory that can be used to create the fakesrc element a fake data source. The function gst_element_factory_create will use the element factory to create an element with the given name. \n"});
