An example of one such element could for example be an Ogg demuxer for an Ogg stream containing both audio and video. One source pad will contain the elementary video stream another will contain the elementary audio stream. Demuxers will generally fire signals when a new pad is created. The application programmer can then handle the new elementary stream in the signal handler. \n"});
