fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "application-development/basics/pads.html#creating-capabilities-for-filtering", "fragment": "Creating capabilities for filtering \nWhile capabilities are mainly used inside a plugin to describe the media type of the pads the application programmer often also has to have basic understanding of capabilities in order to interface with the plugins especially when using filtered caps. When you re using filtered caps or fixation you re limiting the allowed types of media that can stream between two pads to a subset of their supported media types. You do this using a capsfilter element in your pipeline. In order to do this you also need to create your own GstCaps. The easiest way to do this is by using the convenience function gst_caps_new_simple \nThis will force the data flow between those two elements to a certain video format width height and framerate or the linking will fail if that cannot be achieved in the context of the elements involved Keep in mind that when you use gst_element_link_filtered it will automatically create a capsfilter element for you and insert it into your bin or pipeline between the two elements you want to connect this is important if you ever want to disconnect those elements because then you will have to disconnect both elements from the capsfilter instead \nIn some cases you will want to create a more elaborate set of capabilities to filter a link between two pads. Then this function is too simplistic and you ll want to use the method gst_caps_new_full \nSee the API references for the full API of GstStructure and GstCaps. \n"});
