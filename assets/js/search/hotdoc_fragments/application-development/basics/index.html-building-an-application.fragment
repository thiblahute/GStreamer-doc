We will use a visual representation of these objects so that we can visualize the more complex pipelines you will learn to build later on. You will get a first glance at the GStreamer API which should be enough for building elementary applications. Later on in this part you will also learn to build a basic command line application. \nNote that this part will give a look into the low level API and concepts of GStreamer. Once you re going to build applications you might want to use higher level APIs. Those will be discussed later on in this manual. \n"});
