You do not deal with the individual elements anymore but with just one element the bin. We will see that this is extremely powerful when you are going to construct complex pipelines since it allows you to break up the pipeline in smaller chunks. \nThe bin will also manage the elements contained in it. It will perform state changes on the elements as well as collect and forward bus messages. \n\n"});
