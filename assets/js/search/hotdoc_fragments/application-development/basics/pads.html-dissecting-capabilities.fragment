Internally a GstCaps will contain one or more GstStructure that will describe one media type. A negotiated pad will have capabilities set that contain exactly one structure. Also this structure will contain only fixed values. These constraints are not true for unnegotiated pads or pad templates. \nAs an example below is a dump of the capabilities of the vorbisdec element which you will get by running gst inspect vorbisdec. You will see two pads a source and a sink pad. Both of these pads are always available and both have capabilities attached to them. The sink pad will accept vorbis encoded audio data with the media type audio x vorbis The source pad will be used to send raw decoded audio samples to the next element with a raw audio media type in this case audio x raw The source pad will also contain properties for the audio samplerate and the amount of channels plus some more that you don t need to worry about for now. \n"});
