If you set a bin or a pipeline which is a special top level type of bin to a certain target state using gst_element_set_state it will make sure all elements contained within it will also be set to this state. This means it s usually only necessary to set the state of the top level pipeline to start up the pipeline or shut it down. \nThe bin will perform the state changes on all its children from the sink element to the source element. This ensures that the downstream element is ready to receive data when the upstream element is brought to PAUSED or PLAYING. Similarly when shutting down the sink elements will be set to READY or NULL first which will cause the upstream elements to receive a FLUSHING error and stop the streaming threads before the elements are set to the READY or NULL state. \nNote however that if elements are added to a bin or pipeline that s already running e.g. from within a pad added signal callback its state will not automatically be brought in line with the current state or target state of the bin or pipeline it was added to. Instead you have to need to set it to the desired target state yourself using gst_element_set_state or gst_element_sync_state_with_parent when adding elements to an already running pipeline. \n"});
