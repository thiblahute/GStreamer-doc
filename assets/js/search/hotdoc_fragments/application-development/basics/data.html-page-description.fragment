Buffers contain the actual media data. Events contain control information such as seeking information and end of stream notifiers. All this will flow through the pipeline automatically when it s running. This chapter is mostly meant to explain the concept to you you don t need to do anything for this. \nBuffers contain the data that will flow through the pipeline you have created. A source element will typically create a new buffer and pass it through a pad to the next element in the chain. When using the GStreamer infrastructure to create a media pipeline you will not have to deal with buffers yourself the elements will do that for you. \nA buffer consists amongst others of \nPointers to memory objects. Memory objects encapsulate a region in the memory. \nA timestamp for the buffer. \nA refcount that indicates how many elements are using this buffer. This refcount will be used to destroy the buffer when no element has a reference to it. \nBuffer flags. \nThe simple case is that a buffer is created memory allocated data put in it and passed to the next element. That element reads the data does something like creating a new buffer and decoding into it and unreferences the buffer. This causes the data to be free ed and the buffer to be destroyed. A typical video or audio decoder works like this. \nThere are more complex scenarios though. Elements can modify buffers in place i.e. without allocating a new one. Elements can also write to hardware memory such as from video capture sources or memory allocated from the X server using XShm Buffers can be read only and so on. \nEvents are control particles that are sent both up and downstream in a pipeline along with buffers. Downstream events notify fellow elements of stream states. Possible events include seeking flushes end of stream notifications and so on. Upstream events are used both in application element interaction as well as element element interaction to request changes in stream state such as seeks. For applications only upstream events are important. Downstream events are just explained to get a more complete picture of the data concept. \nSince most applications seek in time units our example below does so too \nThe function gst_element_seek is a shortcut for this. This is mostly just to show how it all works. \n"});
