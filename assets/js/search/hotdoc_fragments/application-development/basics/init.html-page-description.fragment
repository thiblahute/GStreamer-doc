fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "application-development/basics/init.html#page-description", "fragment": "When writing a GStreamer application you can simply include gst gst.h to get access to the library functions. Besides that you will also need to initialize the GStreamer library. \nBefore the GStreamer libraries can be used gst_init has to be called from the main application. This call will perform the necessary initialization of the library as well as parse the GStreamer specific command line options. \nA typical program would have code to initialize GStreamer that looks like this \nUse the GST_VERSION_MAJOR GST_VERSION_MINOR and GST_VERSION_MICRO macros to get the GStreamer version you are building against or use the function gst_version to get the version your application is linked against. GStreamer currently uses a scheme where versions with the same major and minor versions are API and ABI compatible. \nIt is also possible to call the gst_init function with two NULL arguments in which case no command line options will be parsed by GStreamer. \nYou can also use a GOption table to initialize your own parameters as shown in the next example \nAs shown in this fragment you can use a GOption table to define your application specific command line options and pass this table to the GLib initialization function along with the option group returned from the function gst_init_get_option_group. Your application options will be parsed in addition to the standard GStreamer options. \n"});
