There are also convenience functions available gst_bin_new and gst_pipeline_new To add elements to a bin or remove elements from a bin you can use gst_bin_add and gst_bin_remove Note that the bin that you add an element to will take ownership of that element. If you destroy the bin the element will be dereferenced with it. If you remove an element from a bin it will be dereferenced automatically. \nThere are various functions to lookup elements in a bin. The most commonly used are gst_bin_get_by_name and gst_bin_get_by_interface You can also iterate over all elements that a bin contains using the function gst_bin_iterate_elements See the API references of GstBin for details. \n"});
