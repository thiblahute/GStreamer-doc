They operate on data that they receive on their input sink pads and will provide data on their output source pads. Examples of such elements are a volume element filter a video scaler convertor an Ogg demuxer or a Vorbis decoder. \nFilter like elements can have any number of source or sink pads. A video demuxer for example would have one sink pad and several N source pads one for each elementary stream contained in the container format. Decoders on the other hand will only have one source and sink pads. \n\n"});
