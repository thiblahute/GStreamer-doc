fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "application-development/basics/data.html#events", "fragment": "Events \nEvents are control particles that are sent both up and downstream in a pipeline along with buffers. Downstream events notify fellow elements of stream states. Possible events include seeking flushes end of stream notifications and so on. Upstream events are used both in application element interaction as well as element element interaction to request changes in stream state such as seeks. For applications only upstream events are important. Downstream events are just explained to get a more complete picture of the data concept. \nSince most applications seek in time units our example below does so too \nThe function gst_element_seek is a shortcut for this. This is mostly just to show how it all works. \n"});
