fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "application-development/basics/pads.html#pads", "fragment": "Pads \nA pad type is defined by two properties its direction and its availability. As we ve mentioned before GStreamer defines two pad directions source pads and sink pads. This terminology is defined from the view of within the element elements receive data on their sink pads and generate data on their source pads. Schematically sink pads are drawn on the left side of an element whereas source pads are drawn on the right side of an element. In such graphs data flows from left to right. \nPad directions are very simple compared to pad availability. A pad can have any of three availabilities always sometimes and on request. The meaning of those three types is exactly as it says always pads always exist sometimes pad exist only in certain cases and can disappear randomly and on request pads appear only if explicitly requested by applications. \n"});
