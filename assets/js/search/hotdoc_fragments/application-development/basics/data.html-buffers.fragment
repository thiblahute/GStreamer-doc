A source element will typically create a new buffer and pass it through a pad to the next element in the chain. When using the GStreamer infrastructure to create a media pipeline you will not have to deal with buffers yourself the elements will do that for you. \nA buffer consists amongst others of \nPointers to memory objects. Memory objects encapsulate a region in the memory. \nA timestamp for the buffer. \nA refcount that indicates how many elements are using this buffer. This refcount will be used to destroy the buffer when no element has a reference to it. \nBuffer flags. \nThe simple case is that a buffer is created memory allocated data put in it and passed to the next element. That element reads the data does something like creating a new buffer and decoding into it and unreferences the buffer. This causes the data to be free ed and the buffer to be destroyed. A typical video or audio decoder works like this. \nThere are more complex scenarios though. Elements can modify buffers in place i.e. without allocating a new one. Elements can also write to hardware memory such as from video capture sources or memory allocated from the X server using XShm Buffers can be read only and so on. \n"});
