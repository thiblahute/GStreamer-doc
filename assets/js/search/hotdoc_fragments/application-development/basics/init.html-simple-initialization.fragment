This call will perform the necessary initialization of the library as well as parse the GStreamer specific command line options. \nA typical program would have code to initialize GStreamer that looks like this \nUse the GST_VERSION_MAJOR GST_VERSION_MINOR and GST_VERSION_MICRO macros to get the GStreamer version you are building against or use the function gst_version to get the version your application is linked against. GStreamer currently uses a scheme where versions with the same major and minor versions are API and ABI compatible. \nIt is also possible to call the gst_init function with two NULL arguments in which case no command line options will be parsed by GStreamer. \n"});
