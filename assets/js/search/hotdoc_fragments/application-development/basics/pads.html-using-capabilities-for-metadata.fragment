Capabilities GstCaps are represented as an array of one or more GstStructures and each GstStructure is an array of fields where each field consists of a field name string e.g. width and a typed value e.g. G_TYPE_INT or GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE \nNote that there is a distinct difference between the possible capabilities of a pad ie. usually what you find as caps of pad templates as they are shown in gst inspect the allowed caps of a pad can be the same as the pad s template caps or a subset of them depending on the possible caps of the peer pad and lastly negotiated caps these describe the exact format of a stream or buffer and contain exactly one structure and have no variable bits like ranges or lists ie. they are fixed caps \nYou can get values of properties in a set of capabilities by querying individual properties of one structure. You can get a structure from a caps using gst_caps_get_structure and the number of structures in a GstCaps using gst_caps_get_size \nCaps are called simple caps when they contain only one structure and fixed caps when they contain only one structure and have no variable field types like ranges or lists of possible values Two other special types of caps are ANY caps and empty caps. \nHere is an example of how to extract the width and height from a set of fixed video caps \n"});
