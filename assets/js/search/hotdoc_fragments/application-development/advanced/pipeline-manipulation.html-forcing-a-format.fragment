You can do this by forcing a specific GstCaps on the pipeline which is possible by using filtered caps. You can set a filtered caps on a link by using the capsfilter element in between the two elements and specifying a GstCaps as caps property on this element. It will then only allow types matching that specified capability set for negotiation. See also Creating capabilities for filtering. \n"});
