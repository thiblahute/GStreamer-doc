This has already been discussed before in Using capabilities for metadata. Therefore we will skip it here. Note that this requires access to all pads of which you want stream information. \nTag reading is done through a bus in GStreamer which has been discussed previously in Bus. You can listen for GST_MESSAGE_TAG messages and handle them as you wish. \nNote however that the GST_MESSAGE_TAG message may be fired multiple times in the pipeline. It is the application s responsibility to put all those tags together and display them to the user in a nice coherent way. Usually using gst_tag_list_merge is a good enough way of doing this make sure to empty the cache when loading a new song or after every few minutes when listening to internet radio. Also make sure you use GST_TAG_MERGE_PREPEND as merging mode so that a new title which came in later has a preference over the old one for display. \nThe following example will extract tags from a file and print them \n"});
