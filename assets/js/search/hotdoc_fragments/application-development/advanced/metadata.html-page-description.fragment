fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "application-development/advanced/metadata.html#page-description", "fragment": "GStreamer makes a clear distinction between the two types of metadata it supports Stream tags which describe the content of a stream in a non technical way and Stream info which is a somewhat technical description of the properties of a stream. Stream tags examples include the author of a song the song s title or the album it belongs to. Examples for stream info include video size audio samplerate codecs used and so on. \nTags are handled using the GStreamer tagging system. Stream info can be retrieved from a GstPad by getting the current negotiated GstCaps for that pad. \nStream information can most easily be obtained by reading it from a GstPad. Note that this requires access to all pads of which you want stream information. This approach has already been discussed in Using capabilities for metadata. Therefore we will skip it here. \nTag reading is done through a bus in GStreamer. You can listen for GST_MESSAGE_TAG messages and handle them as you wish. This has been discussed previously in Bus. \nNote however that the GST_MESSAGE_TAG message may be emitted multiple times and it is the application s responsibility to aggregate and display the tags in a coherent way. This can be done using gst_tag_list_merge but make sure to empty the cache when loading a new song or after every few minutes when listening to internet radio. Also make sure you use GST_TAG_MERGE_PREPEND as merging mode so that a new title which came in later has precedence over the old one. \nThe following example shows how to extract tags from a file and print them \nTag writing is done using the GstTagSetter interface. All that s required is a tag set supporting element in your pipeline. \nIn order to see if any of the elements in your pipeline supports tag writing you can use the function gst_bin_iterate_all_by_interface pipeline GST_TYPE_TAG_SETTER On the resulting element usually an encoder or muxer you can use gst_tag_setter_merge with a taglist or gst_tag_setter_add with individual tags to set tags on it. \nA nice extra feature in GStreamer s tag support is that tags are preserved in pipelines. This means that if you transcode one file containing tags into another tag supporting media type then the tags will be handled as part of the data stream and will be so merged into the newly written media file. \n"});
