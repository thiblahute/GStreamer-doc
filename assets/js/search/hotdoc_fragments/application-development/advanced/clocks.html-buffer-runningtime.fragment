First we can convert the SEGMENT event into a GstSegment object and then we can use the gst_segment_to_running_time function to perform the calculation of the buffer running time. \nSynchronization is now a matter of making sure that a buffer with a certain running time is played when the clock reaches the same running time. Usually this task is done by sink elements. Sink also have to take into account the latency configured in the pipeline and add this to the buffer running time before synchronizing to the pipeline clock. \nNon live sources timestamp buffers with a running time starting from After a flushing seek they will produce buffers again from a running time of \nLive sources need to timestamp buffers with a running time matching the pipeline running time when the first byte of the buffer was captured. \n"});
