You will get the following information from the message \nWhen a new thread is about to be created you will be notified of this with a GST_STREAM_STATUS_TYPE_CREATE type. It is then possible to configure a GstTaskPool in the GstTask. The custom taskpool will provide custom threads for the task to implement the streaming threads. \nThis message needs to be handled synchronously if you want to configure a custom taskpool. If you don t configure the taskpool on the task when this message returns the task will use its default pool. \nWhen a thread is entered or left.
