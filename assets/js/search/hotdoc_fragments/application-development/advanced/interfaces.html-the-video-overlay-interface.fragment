The application provides an window handle to the element implementing this interface to draw on and the element will then use this window handle to draw on rather than creating a new toplevel window. This is useful to embed video in video players. \nThis interface is implemented by amongst others the Video4linux2 elements and by ximagesink xvimagesink and sdlvideosink. \n"});
