Some people have also expressed the wish to grab the output in a pipeline and take care of the actual output inside their application. While either of these methods are strongly discouraged GStreamer offers support for this. Beware You need to know what you are doing. Since you don t have any support from a base class you need to thoroughly understand state changes and synchronization. If it doesn t work there are a million ways to shoot yourself in the foot. It s always better to simply write a plugin and have the base class manage it. See the Plugin Writer s Guide for more information on this topic. Also see the next section which will explain how to embed plugins statically in your application. \nThere s two possible elements that you can use for the above mentioned purposes. Those are called appsrc an imaginary source and appsink an imaginary sink The same method applies to each of those elements. Here we will discuss how to use those elements to insert using appsrc or grab using appsink data from a pipeline and how to set negotiation. \nBoth appsrc and appsink provide sets of API. One API uses standard GObject action signals and properties. The same API is also available as a regular C api. The C api is more performant but requires you to link to the app library in order to use the elements. \n"});
