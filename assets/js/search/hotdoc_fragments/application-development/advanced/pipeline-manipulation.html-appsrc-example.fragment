We use a colorspace conversion element to make sure that we feed the right format to your X server. We configure a video stream with a variable framerate and we set the timestamps on the outgoing buffers in such a way that we play frames per second. \nNote how we use the pull mode method of pushing new buffers into appsrc although appsrc is running in push mode. \n"});
