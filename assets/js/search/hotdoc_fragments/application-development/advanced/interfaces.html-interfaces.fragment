This method suffices for the simple n straight settings but fails for anything more complicated than a getter and setter. For the more complicated use cases GStreamer uses interfaces based on the GObject GTypeInterface type. \nMost of the interfaces handled here will not contain any example code. See the API references for details. Here we will just describe the scope and purpose of each interface. \n"});
