With\nthe basics you learned in the previous part you should be able to create\na <em>simple</em> application. However, GStreamer provides much more candy than\njust the basics of playing back audio files. In this chapter, you will\nlearn more of the low-level features and internals of GStreamer.</p>\n<p>Some parts of this part will serve mostly as an explanation of how\nGStreamer works internally; they are not actually needed for actual\napplication development. This includes chapters such as the ones\ncovering scheduling, autoplugging and synchronization. Other chapters,\nhowever, discuss more advanced ways of pipeline-application interaction,\nand can turn out to be very useful for certain applications. This\nincludes the chapters on metadata, querying and events, interfaces,\ndynamic parameters and pipeline data manipulation.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
