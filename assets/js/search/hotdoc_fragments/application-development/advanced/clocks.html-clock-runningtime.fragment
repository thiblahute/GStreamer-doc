The clock time doesn t always start from or from some known value. Some clocks start counting from some known start date other clocks start counting since last reboot etc... \nA GstClock returns the absolute time according to that clock with gst_clock_get_time The absolute time or clock time of a clock is monotonically increasing. From the absolute time is a running time calculated which is simply the difference between a previous snapshot of the absolute time called the base time. So \nrunning time absolute time base time \nA GStreamer GstPipeline object maintains a GstClock object and a base time when it goes to the PLAYING state. The pipeline gives a handle to the selected GstClock to each element in the pipeline along with selected base time. The pipeline will select a base time in such a way that the running time reflects the total time spent in the PLAYING state. As a result when the pipeline is PAUSED the running time stands still. \nBecause all objects in the pipeline have the same clock and base time they can thus all calculate the running time according to the pipeline clock. \n"});
