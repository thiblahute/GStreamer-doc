It does this by doing a LATENCY query on all the sinks in the pipeline. The pipeline then selects the maximum latency in the pipeline and configures this with a LATENCY event. \nAll sink elements will delay playback by the value in the LATENCY event. Since all sinks delay with the same amount of time they will be relative in sync. \n"});
