This includes getting the length of a stream if available or getting the current position. Those stream properties can be retrieved in various formats such as time audio samples video frames or bytes. The function most commonly used for this is gst_element_query although some convenience wrappers are provided as well such as gst_element_query_position and gst_element_query_duration You can generally query the pipeline directly and it ll figure out the internal details for you like which element to query. \nInternally queries will be sent to the sinks and dispatched backwards until one element can handle it that result will be sent back to the function caller. Usually that is the demuxer although with live sources from a webcam it is the source itself. \n"});
