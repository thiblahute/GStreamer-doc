Elements can choose if their pads are to be scheduled push based or pull based. An element can for example choose to start a thread to start pulling from the sink pad or and start pushing on the source pad. An element can also choose to use the upstream or downstream thread for its data processing in push and pull mode respectively. GStreamer does not pose any restrictions on how the element chooses to be scheduled. See the Plugin Writer Guide for more details. \nWhat will happen in any case is that some elements will start a thread for their data processing called the streaming threads The streaming threads or GstTask objects are created from a GstTaskPool when the element needs to make a streaming thread. In the next section we see how we can receive notifications of the tasks and pools. \n"});
