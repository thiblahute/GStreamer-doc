Most threading internals are hidden from the application which should make application development easier. However in some cases applications may want to have influence on some parts of those. GStreamer allows applications to force the use of multiple threads over some parts of a pipeline. See When would you want to force a thread \nGStreamer can also notify you when threads are created so that you can configure things such as the thread priority or the threadpool to use. See Configuring Threads in GStreamer. \n"});
