GStreamer obviously supports many more location sources. However we don t want applications to need to know any particular element implementation details such as element names for particular network source types and so on. Therefore there is a URI interface which can be used to get the source element that supports a particular URI type. There is no strict rule for URI naming but in general we follow naming conventions that others use too. For example assuming you have the correct plugins installed GStreamer supports file path file http host path file mms host path file and so on. \nIn order to get the source or sink element supporting a particular URI use gst_element_make_from_uri with the URI type being either GST_URI_SRC for a source element or GST_URI_SINK for a sink element. \nYou can convert filenames to and from URIs using GLib s g_filename_to_uri and g_uri_to_filename \n"});
