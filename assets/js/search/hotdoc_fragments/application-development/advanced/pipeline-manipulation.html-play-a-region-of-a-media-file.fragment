The goal is to only play the part of a file from seconds to seconds and then EOS. \nIn a first step we will set a uridecodebin element to the PAUSED state and make sure that we block all the source pads that are created. When all the source pads are blocked we have data on all source pads and we say that the uridecodebin is prerolled. \nIn a prerolled pipeline we can ask for the duration of the media and we can also perform seeks. We are interested in performing a seek operation on the pipeline to select the range of media that we are interested in. \nAfter we configure the region we are interested in we can link the sink element unblock the source pads and set the pipeline to the playing state. You will see that exactly the requested region is played by the sink before it goes to EOS. \nWhat follows is an example application that loosly follows this algorithm. \nNote that we use a custom application message to signal the main thread that the uridecidebin is prerolled. The main thread will then issue a flushing seek to the requested region. The flush will temporarily unblock the pad and reblock them when new data arrives again. We detect this second block to remove the probes. Then we set the pipeline to PLAYING and it should play from to seconds then EOS and exit the application. \n"});
