A queue is the thread boundary element through which you can force the use of threads. It does so by using a classic provider consumer model as learned in threading classes at universities all around the world. By doing this it acts both as a means to make data throughput between threads threadsafe and it can also act as a buffer. Queues have several GObject properties to be configured for specific uses. For example you can set lower and upper thresholds for the element. If there s less data than the lower threshold default disabled it will block output. If there s more data than the upper threshold it will block input or if configured to do so drop data. \nTo use a queue and therefore force the use of two distinct threads in the pipeline one can simply create a queue element and put this in as part of the pipeline. GStreamer will take care of all threading details internally. \n"});
