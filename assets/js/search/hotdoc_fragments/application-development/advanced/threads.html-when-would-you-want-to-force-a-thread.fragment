However for performance reasons you never want to use one thread for every element out there since that will create some overhead. Let s now list some situations where threads can be particularly useful \nData buffering for example when dealing with network streams or when recording data from a live stream such as a video or audio card. Short hickups elsewhere in the pipeline will not cause data loss. See also Stream buffering about network buffering with queue2. \n\n"});
