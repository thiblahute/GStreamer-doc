By using alternative elements you are able to build media players for other media types such as Ogg Speex MP3 or even video formats. However you would rather want to build an application that can automatically detect the media type of a stream and automatically generate the best possible pipeline by looking at all available elements in a system. This process is called autoplugging and GStreamer contains high quality autopluggers. If you re looking for an autoplugger don t read any further and go to Playback Components. This chapter will explain the concept of autoplugging and typefinding. It will explain what systems GStreamer includes to dynamically detect the type of a media stream and how to generate a pipeline of decoder elements to playback this media. The same principles can also be used for transcoding. Because of the full dynamicity of this concept GStreamer can be automatically extended to support new media types without needing any adaptations to its autopluggers. \nWe will first introduce the concept of Media types as a dynamic and extendible way of identifying media streams. After that we will introduce the concept of typefinding to find the type of a media stream. Lastly we will explain how autoplugging and the GStreamer registry can be used to setup a pipeline that will convert media from one mediatype to another for example for media decoding. \n"});
