fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "application-development/advanced/metadata.html#metadata", "fragment": "Metadata \nGStreamer makes a clear distinction between two types of metadata and has support for both types. The first is stream tags which describe the content of a stream in a non technical way. Examples include the author of a song the title of that very same song or the album it is a part of. The other type of metadata is stream info which is a somewhat technical description of the properties of a stream. This can include video size audio samplerate codecs used and so on. Tags are handled using the GStreamer tagging system. Stream info can be retrieved from a GstPad by getting the current negotiated GstCaps for that pad. \n"});
