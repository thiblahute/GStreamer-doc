For most container formats those are the files that you will find on your hard disk Ogg for example is a container format no properties are needed to describe the stream. Only a media type is needed. A full list of media types and accompanying properties can be found in the Plugin Writer s Guide. \nAn element must associate a media type to its source and sink pads when it is loaded into the system. GStreamer knows about the different elements and what type of data they expect and emit through the GStreamer registry. This allows for very dynamic and extensible element creation as we will see. \nIn Your first application we ve learned to build a music player for Ogg Vorbis files. Let s look at the media types associated with each pad in this pipeline. The Hello world pipeline with media types shows what media type belongs to each pad in this pipeline. \n\n"});
