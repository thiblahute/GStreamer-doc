This method suffices for simple getters and setters but fails for anything more complicated. For more complex use cases GStreamer uses interfaces based on the GObject GTypeInterface type. \nThis text is meant to be introductory and does not include source code examples. Please take a look a the API reference for additional details. \nIn our examples so far we have only showed support for local files using the filesrc element but GStreamer supports many more location sources. \nGStreamer doesn t require applications to know any URI specifics like what element to use for a particular network source types. These details are abstracted by the GstURIHandler interface. \nThere is no strict rule for URI naming but in general we follow common usage naming conventions. For example assuming you have the correct plugins installed GStreamer supports \nIn order to get the source or sink element supporting a particular URI use gst_element_make_from_uri with GST_URI_SRC or GST_URI_SINK as GstURIType depending in the direction you need. \nYou can convert filenames to and from URIs using GLib s g_filename_to_uri and g_uri_to_filename \nThe GstColorBalance interface is a way to control video related properties on an element such as brightness contrast and so on. It s sole reason for existence is that as far as its authors know there s no way to dynamically register properties using GObject. \nThe colorbalance interface is implemented by several plugins including xvimagesink glimagesink and the Video4linux2 elements. \nThe GstVideoOverlay interface was created to solve the problem of embedding video streams in an application window. The application provides a window handle to an element implementing this interface and the element will then use this window handle to draw on rather than creating a new toplevel window. This is useful to embed video in video players. \nThis interface is implemented by amongst others the Video4linux2 elements and by glimagesink ximagesink xvimagesink and sdlvideosink. \nThere are quite a few other interfaces provided by GStreamer and implemented by some of its elements. Among them \n"});
