Optionally the queue size in the appsrc can be controlled with the enough data and need data signals by respectively stopping starting the push buffer calls. The value of the min percent property defines how empty the internal appsrc queue needs to be before the need data signal will be fired. You can set this to some value to avoid completely draining the queue. \nWhen the stream type is set to seekable don t forget to implement a seek data callback. \nUse this model when implementing various network protocols or hardware devices. \n"});
