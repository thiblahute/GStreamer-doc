Most application developers will be interested in providing feedback to the user on media progress. Media players for example will want to show a slider showing the progress in the song and usually also a label indicating stream length. Transcoding applications will want to show a progress bar on how much percent of the task is done. GStreamer has built in support for doing all this using a concept known as querying. Since seeking is very similar it will be discussed here as well. Seeking is done using the concept of events. \n"});
