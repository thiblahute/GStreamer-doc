Each part addresses a particular broad topic concerning GStreamer appliction development. The parts of this guide are laid out in the following order \nAbout GStreamer gives you an overview of GStreamer its design principles and foundations. \nBuilding an Application covers the basics of GStreamer application programming. At the end of this part you should be able to build your own audio player using GStreamer \nIn Advanced GStreamer concepts we will move on to advanced subjects which make GStreamer stand out of its competitors. We will discuss application pipeline interaction using dynamic parameters and interfaces we will discuss threading and threaded pipelines scheduling and clocks and synchronization Most of those topics are not just there to introduce you to their API but primarily to give a deeper insight in solving application programming problems with GStreamer and understanding their concepts. \nNext in Higher level interfaces for GStreamer applications we will go into higher level programming APIs for GStreamer. You don t exactly need to know all the details from the previous parts to understand this but you will need to understand basic GStreamer concepts nevertheless. We will amongst others discuss playbin and autopluggers. \nFinally in Appendices you will find some random information on integrating with GNOME KDE OS X or Windows some debugging help and general tips to improve and simplify GStreamer programming. \n"});
