GStreamer provides a function gst_parse_launch that you can use to construct a pipeline. The following program lets you create an MP3 pipeline using the gst_parse_launch function \nNote how we can retrieve the filesrc element from the constructed bin using the element name. \nThe gst launch syntax is processed by a flex bison parser. This section is intended to provide a full specification of the grammar any deviations from this specification is considered a bug. \nA bare identifier a string beginning with a letter and containing only letters numbers dashes underscores percent signs or colons will create an element from a given element factory. In this example an instance of the mad MP3 decoding plugin will be created. \nAn exclamation point optionally having a qualified pad name an the name of the pad optionally preceded by the name of the element on both sides will link two pads. If the source pad is not specified a source pad from the immediately preceding element will be automatically chosen. If the sink pad is not specified a sink pad from the next element to be constructed will be chosen. An attempt will be made to find compatible pads. Pad names may be preceded by an element name as in my_element_name.sink_pad. \nThe name of a property optionally qualified with an element name and a value separated by an equals sign will set a property on an element. If the element is not specified the previous element is assumed. Strings can optionally be enclosed in quotation marks. Characters in strings may be escaped with the backtick If the right hand side is all digits it is considered to be an integer. If it is all digits and a decimal point it is a double. If it is true false TRUE or FALSE it is considered to be boolean. Otherwise it is parsed as a string. The type of the property is determined later on in the parsing and the value is converted to the target type. This conversion is not guaranteed to work it relies on the g_value_convert routines. No error message will be displayed on an invalid conversion due to limitations in the value convert API. \nA pipeline description between parentheses is placed into a bin. The open paren may be preceded by a type name as in jackbin. to make a bin of a specified type. Square brackets make pipelines and curly braces make threads. The default toplevel bin type is a pipeline although putting the whole description within parentheses or braces can override this default. \nThis is a tool to query a plugin or an element about its properties. \nTo query the information about the element mad you would specify \nBelow is the output of a query for the osssink element \nTo query the information about a plugin you would do \n"});
