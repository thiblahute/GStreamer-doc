Amongst others GStreamer includes elements for ALSA alsasrc alsasink OSS osssrc osssink Pulesaudio pulsesrc pulsesink and Sun audio sunaudiosrc sunaudiomixer sunaudiosink \nFor video input GStreamer contains source elements for Video4linux2 v4l2src v4l2element v4l2sink \nFor video output GStreamer provides elements for output to X windows ximagesink Xv windows xvimagesink for hardware accelerated video direct framebuffer dfbimagesink and openGL image contexts glsink \nThere are different makefiles that can be used to build GStreamer with the usual Microsoft compiling tools. \nThe Makefile is meant to be used with the GNU make program and the free version of the Microsoft compiler http msdn.microsoft.com visualc vctoolkit2003 You also have to modify your system environment variables to use it from the command line. You will also need a working Platform SDK for Windows that is available for free from Microsoft. \nThe projects makefiles will generate automatically some source files needed to compile GStreamer. That requires that you have installed on your system some GNU tools and that they are available in your system PATH. \nThe GStreamer project depends on other libraries namely \nGLib \nlibxml2 \nlibintl \nlibiconv \nWork is being done to provide pre compiled GStreamer libraries as a packages for win32. Check the GStreamer web site and check our mailing list for the latest developments in this respect. \nNote \nGNU tools needed that you can find on http gnuwin32.sourceforge.net \nGNU flex tested with \nGNU bison tested with \nand http www.mingw.org \nthe generated files from the auto makefiles will be available soon separately on the net for convenience people who don t want to install GNU tools \n"});
