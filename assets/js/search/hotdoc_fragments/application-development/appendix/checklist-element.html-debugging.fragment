Elements will write output to this system to log what they re doing. It s not used for error reporting but it is very useful for tracking what an element is doing exactly which can come in handy when debugging application issues such as failing seeks out of sync media etc. \nMost GStreamer based applications accept the commandline option gst debug LIST and related family members. The list consists of a comma separated list of category level pairs which can set the debugging level for a specific debugging category. For example gst debug oggdemux would turn on debugging for the Ogg demuxer element. You can use wildcards as well. A debugging level of will turn off all debugging and a level of will turn on all debugging. Intermediate values only turn on some debugging based on message severity for example will only display errors and warnings Here s a list of all available options \ngst debug help will print available debug categories and exit. \ngst debug level LEVEL will set the default debug level which can range from no output to everything \ngst debug LIST takes a comma separated list of category_name level pairs to set specific levels for the individual categories. Example GST_AUTOPLUG avidemux Alternatively you can also set the GST_DEBUG environment variable which has the same effect. \ngst debug no color will disable color debugging. You can also set the GST_DEBUG_NO_COLOR environment variable to if you want to disable colored debug output permanently. Note that if you are disabling color purely to avoid messing up your pager output try using less R. \ngst debug color mode MODE will change debug log coloring mode. MODE can be one of the following on off auto disable unix. You can also set the GST_DEBUG_COLOR_MODE environment variable if you want to change colored debug output permanently. Note that if you are disabling color purely to avoid messing up your pager output try using less R. \ngst debug disable disables debugging altogether. \ngst plugin spew enables printout of errors while loading GStreamer plugins. \n"});
