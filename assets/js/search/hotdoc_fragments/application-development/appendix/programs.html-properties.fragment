fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "application-development/appendix/programs.html#properties", "fragment": "Properties \nThe name of a property optionally qualified with an element name and a value separated by an equals sign will set a property on an element. If the element is not specified the previous element is assumed. Strings can optionally be enclosed in quotation marks. Characters in strings may be escaped with the backtick If the right hand side is all digits it is considered to be an integer. If it is all digits and a decimal point it is a double. If it is true false TRUE or FALSE it is considered to be boolean. Otherwise it is parsed as a string. The type of the property is determined later on in the parsing and the value is converted to the target type. This conversion is not guaranteed to work it relies on the g_value_convert routines. No error message will be displayed on an invalid conversion due to limitations in the value convert API. \n"});
