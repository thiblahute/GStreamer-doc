You will also need a working Platform SDK for Windows that is available for free from Microsoft. \nThe projects makefiles will generate automatically some source files needed to compile GStreamer. That requires that you have installed on your system some GNU tools and that they are available in your system PATH. \nThe GStreamer project depends on other libraries namely \nGLib \nlibxml2 \nlibintl \nlibiconv \nWork is being done to provide pre compiled GStreamer libraries as a packages for win32.
