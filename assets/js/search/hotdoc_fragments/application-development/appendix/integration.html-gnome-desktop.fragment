Nowadays a whole bunch of GNOME applications make use of GStreamer for media processing including but not limited to Rhythmbox Videos and Sound Juicer. \nMost of these GNOME applications make use of some specific techniques to integrate as closely as possible with the GNOME desktop \nGNOME applications usually call gtk_init to parse command line options and initialize GTK. GStreamer applications would normally call gst_init to do the same for GStreamer. This would mean that only one of the two can parse command line options. To work around this issue GStreamer can provide a GLib GOptionGroup which can be passed to gnome_program_init The following example requires GTK or newer previous GTK versions do not support command line parsing via GOption yet \nGNOME uses Pulseaudio for audio use the pulsesrc and pulsesink elements to have access to all the features. \nGStreamer provides data input output elements for use with the GIO VFS system. These elements are called giosrc and giosink The deprecated GNOME VFS system is supported too but shouldn t be used for any new applications. \n"});
