GStreamer has much better support for win32 than previous versions though and should usually compile and work out of the box both using MSYS MinGW or Microsoft compilers. The GStreamer web site and the mailing list archives are a good place to check the latest win32 related news. \nGStreamer builds using Microsoft Visual C NET and using Cygwin. \n"});
