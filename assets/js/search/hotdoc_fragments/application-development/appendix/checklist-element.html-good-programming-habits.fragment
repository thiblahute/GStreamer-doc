Always report errors in your application and try to do something with warnings and information messages too. \nAlways check return values of GStreamer functions. Especially check return values of gst_element_link and gst_element_set_state \nDereference return values of all functions returning a non base type such as gst_element_get_pad Also always free non const string returns such as gst_object_get_name \nAlways use your pipeline object to keep track of the current state of your pipeline. Don t keep private variables in your application. Also don t update your user interface if a user presses the play button. Instead listen for the state changed message on the GstBus and only update the user interface whenever this message is received. \nReport all bugs that you find in GStreamer bugzilla at http bugzilla.gnome.org \n"});
