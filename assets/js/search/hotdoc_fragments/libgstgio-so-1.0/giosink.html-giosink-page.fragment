This location can be specified using any protocol supported by the GIO library or it s VFS backends. Common protocols are file ftp or smb \nIf the URI or GFile already exists giosink will post a message of type GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT with name file exists on the bus. The message also contains the GFile and the corresponding URI. Applications can use the file exists message to notify the user about the problem and to set a different target location or to remove the existing file. Note that right after the file exists message a normal error message is posted on the bus which should be ignored if file exists is handled by the application for example by calling gst_bus_set_flushing bus TRUE after the file exists message was received and gst_bus_set_flushing bus FALSE after the problem is resolved. \nSimilar to the file exist message a not mounted message is posted on the bus if the target location is not mounted yet and needs to be mounted. This message can be used by application to mount the location and retry after the location was mounted successfully. \n"});
