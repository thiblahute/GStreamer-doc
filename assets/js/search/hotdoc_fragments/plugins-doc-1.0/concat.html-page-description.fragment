Then the next stream is enabled, while\nkeeping the running time continous for <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstFormat.html#GST-FORMAT-TIME:CAPS\">GST_FORMAT_TIME</a> segments or\nkeeping the segment continous for GST_FORMAT_BYTES segments.</p>\n<p>Streams are switched in the order in which the sinkpads were requested.</p>\n<p>By default, the stream segment's base values are adjusted to ensure\nthe segment transitions between streams are continuous. In some cases,\nit may be desirable to turn off these adjustments (for example, because\nanother downstream element like a streamsynchronizer adjusts the base\nvalues on its own). The adjust-base property can be used for this purpose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-launch-line\">Example launch line</h2>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 concat name=c ! xvimagesink  videotestsrc num-buffers=100 ! c.   videotestsrc num-buffers=100 pattern=ball ! c.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Plays two video streams one after another.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
