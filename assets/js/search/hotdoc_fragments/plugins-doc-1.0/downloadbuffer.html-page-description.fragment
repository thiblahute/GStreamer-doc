When\nthe amount of read-ahead data drops below low-percent of the configured max,\nthe element will start emitting BUFFERING messages until high-percent of max is\nreached again.</p>\n<p>The downloadbuffer provides push and pull based scheduling on its source pad\nand will efficiently seek in the upstream element when needed.</p>\n<p>The temp-location property will be used to notify the application of the\nallocated filename.</p>\n<p>When the downloadbuffer has completely downloaded the media, it will\npost an application message named  <code>\"GstCacheDownloadComplete\"</code>\nwith the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>G_TYPE_STRING\n<code>\"location\"</code>:\nthe location of the completely downloaded file.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
