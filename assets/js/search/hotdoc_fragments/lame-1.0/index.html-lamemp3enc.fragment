Note that MP3 is not a free format there are licensing and patent issues to take into consideration. See Ogg Vorbis for a royalty free and often higher quality alternative. \nIf no fixed output sample rate is negotiated on the element s src pad the element will choose an optimal sample rate to resample to internally. For example a bit KHz mono audio stream encoded at kbit will get resampled to KHz. Use filter caps on the src pad to force a particular sample rate. \nEncode a test sine signal to MP3. \nRecord from a sound card using ALSA and encode to MP3 with an average bitrate of kbps \nTranscode from a wav file to MP3 the id3v2mux element is optional with best VBR quality \nEncode Audio CD track to MP3 with a constant bitrate of kbps \nEncode to a fixed sample rate \n"});
