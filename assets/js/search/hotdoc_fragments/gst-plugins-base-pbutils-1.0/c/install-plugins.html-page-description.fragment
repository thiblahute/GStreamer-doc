Example transient for XID where XID is the X Window ID of the main window of the calling application so the installer can make itself transient to that window Unknown optional arguments should be ignored by the installer. \none installer detail string argument for each plugin to be installed these strings will have a gstreamer prefix the exact format of the detail string is explained below \nThe string is in UTF encoding and is made up of several fields separated by characters but neither the first nor the last character is a The fields are \nAn entire ID string might then look like this for example gstreamer totem Vorbis audio decoder decoder audio x vorbis \nPlugin installers parsing this ID string should expect further fields also separated by symbols and either ignore them warn the user or error out when encountering them. \nThose unfamiliar with the GStreamer caps system should note a few things about the caps string used in the above decoder encoder case \nThe installer should return one of the following exit codes when it exits \nIt is up to the vendor to find mechanism to map required components from the detail string to the actual packages plugins to install. This could be a hardcoded list of mappings for example or be part of the packaging system metadata. \nGStreamer plugin files can be introspected for this information. The gst inspect utility has a special command line option that will output information similar to what is required. For example gst inspect print plugin auto install info path to libgstvorbis.so should output something along the lines ofdecoder audio x vorbis element vorbisdecelement vorbisencelement vorbisparse element vorbistag encoder audio x vorbis \nNote that in the encoder and decoder case the introspected caps can be more complex with additional fields e.g. audio mpeg mpegversion int so they will not always exactly match the caps wanted by the application. It is up to the installer to deal with this either by doing proper caps intersection using the GStreamer GstCaps API or by only taking into account the media type \nAnother potential source of problems are plugins such as ladspa or libvisual where the list of elements depends on the installed ladspa libvisual plugins at the time. This is also up to the distribution to handle but usually not relevant for playback applications \nCreates a new GstInstallPluginsContext. \nFrees a GstInstallPluginsContext. \nThis function is used to tell the external installer process whether it should ask for confirmation or not before searching for missing plugins. \nIf set this option will be passed to the installer via a interaction show confirm search hide confirm search command line option. \nThis function is used to pass the calling application s desktop file ID to the external installer process. \nA desktop file ID is the basename of the desktop file including the desktop extension. \nIf set the desktop file ID will be passed to the installer via a desktop id command line option. \nSets the startup notification ID for the launched process. \nThis is typically used to to pass the current X11 event timestamp to the external installer process. \nStartup notification IDs are defined in the FreeDesktop.Org Startup Notifications standard. \nIf set the ID will be passed to the installer via a startup notification id command line option. \nGTK GNOME applications should be able to create a startup notification ID like this \nThis function is for X11 based applications such as most Gtk Qt applications on linux unix only. You can use it to tell the external installer the XID of your main application window. That way the installer can make its own window transient to your application window during the installation. \nIf set the XID will be passed to the installer via a transient for XID command line option. \nGtk Gnome application should be able to obtain the XID of the top level window like this \nChecks whether plugin installation initiated by this application only is currently in progress. \nConvenience function to return the descriptive string associated with a status code. This function returns English strings and should not be used for user messages. It is here only to assist in debugging. \nChecks whether plugin installation is likely to be supported by the current environment. This currently only checks whether the helper script that is to be provided by the distribution or operating system vendor exists. \nOpaque context structure for the plugin installation.
