The actual discovery of the uri will only take place if gst_discoverer_start has been called. \nA copy of uri will be made internally so the caller can safely g_free afterwards. \ngpointer _reserved \nGstDiscovererStreamInfo specific to audio streams. \nGstDiscovererStreamInfo specific to container streams. \nStructure containing the information of a URI analyzed by GstDiscoverer. \nParses a GVariant as produced by gst_discoverer_info_to_variant back to a GstDiscovererInfo. \nFinds all the GstDiscovererAudioInfo contained in info \nFinds all the GstDiscovererContainerInfo contained in info \nGet the installer details for missing elements \nFinds the GstDiscovererStreamInfo contained in info that match the given streamtype. \nFinds all the GstDiscovererSubtitleInfo contained in info \nFinds all the GstDiscovererVideoInfo contained in info \nSerializes info to a GVariant that can be parsed again through gst_discoverer_info_from_variant. \nNote that any GstToc s that might have been discovered will not be serialized for now. \nBase structure for information concerning a media stream. Depending on the stream type one can find more media specific information in GstDiscovererAudioInfo GstDiscovererVideoInfo and GstDiscovererContainerInfo. \nThe GstDiscovererStreamInfo represents the topology of the stream. Siblings can be iterated over with gst_discoverer_stream_info_get_next and gst_discoverer_stream_info_get_previous. Children sub streams of a stream can be accessed using the GstDiscovererContainerInfo API. \nAs a simple example if you run GstDiscoverer on an AVI file with one audio and one video stream you will get a GstDiscovererContainerInfo corresponding to the AVI container which in turn will have a GstDiscovererAudioInfo sub stream and a GstDiscovererVideoInfo sub stream for the audio and video streams respectively. \nDecrements the reference count of all contained GstDiscovererStreamInfo and fress the GList. \nGstDiscovererStreamInfo specific to subtitle streams this includes text and image based ones \nGstDiscovererStreamInfo specific to video streams this includes images \nIncrements the reference count of info. \nDecrements the reference count of info. \nSome plugins are missing for full discovery \nYou can use these flags to control what is serialized by gst_discoverer_info_to_variant \nSerialize only basic information excluding caps tags and miscellaneous information \nGST_DISCOVERER_SERIALIZE_CAPS \n"});
