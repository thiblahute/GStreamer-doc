The actual discovery of the uri will only take place if GstPbutils.Discoverer.start has been called. \nA copy of uri will be made internally so the caller can safely GLib.free afterwards. \ngpointer _reserved \nGstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo specific to audio streams. \nGstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo specific to container streams. \nStructure containing the information of a URI analyzed by GstPbutils.Discoverer. \nParses a GLib.Variant as produced by GstPbutils.DiscovererInfo.to_variant back to a GstPbutils.DiscovererInfo. \nFinds all the GstPbutils.DiscovererAudioInfo contained in info \nFinds all the GstPbutils.DiscovererContainerInfo contained in info \nGet the installer details for missing elements \nFinds the GstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo contained in info that match the given streamtype. \nFinds all the GstPbutils.DiscovererSubtitleInfo contained in info \nFinds all the GstPbutils.DiscovererVideoInfo contained in info \nSerializes info to a GLib.Variant that can be parsed again through GstPbutils.DiscovererInfo.from_variant. \nNote that any Gst.Toc s that might have been discovered will not be serialized for now. \nBase structure for information concerning a media stream. Depending on the stream type one can find more media specific information in GstPbutils.DiscovererAudioInfo GstPbutils.DiscovererVideoInfo and GstPbutils.DiscovererContainerInfo. \nThe GstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo represents the topology of the stream. Siblings can be iterated over with GstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo.get_next and GstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo.get_previous. Children sub streams of a stream can be accessed using the GstPbutils.DiscovererContainerInfo API. \nAs a simple example if you run GstPbutils.Discoverer on an AVI file with one audio and one video stream you will get a GstPbutils.DiscovererContainerInfo corresponding to the AVI container which in turn will have a GstPbutils.DiscovererAudioInfo sub stream and a GstPbutils.DiscovererVideoInfo sub stream for the audio and video streams respectively. \nDecrements the reference count of all contained GstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo and fress the GLib.List. \nGstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo specific to subtitle streams this includes text and image based ones \nGstPbutils.DiscovererStreamInfo specific to video streams this includes images \nResult values for the discovery process. \nSome plugins are missing for full discovery \nYou can use these flags to control what is serialized by GstPbutils.DiscovererInfo.to_variant \nSerialize only basic information excluding caps tags and miscellaneous information \nGstPbutils.DiscovererSerializeFlags.caps \n"});
