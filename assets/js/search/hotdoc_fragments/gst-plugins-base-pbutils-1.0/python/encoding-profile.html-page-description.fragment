If it is not a mandatory stream and can be used as many times as necessary. \nYou can also use the restriction_caps encoded_format_caps syntax to specify the restriction caps to be set on a GstPbutils.EncodingProfile \nIt corresponds to the restriction Gst.Caps to apply before the encoder that will be used in the profile. The fields present in restriction caps are properties of the raw stream that is before encoding such as height and width for video and depth and sampling rate for audio. This property does not make sense for muxers. See GstPbutils.EncodingProfile.get_restriction for more details. \nTo force a video stream to be encoded with a Full HD resolution using WebM as the container format VP8 as the video codec and Vorbis as the audio codec you should use \nNOTE Make sure to enclose into quotes to avoid to be reinterpreted by the shell. \nIn the case you are using encoder types the following is also possible \nMP3 audio and H264 in MP4 \nVorbis and theora in OGG \nAC3 and H264 in MPEG TS \nAnywhere where you have to use a string to define a GstPbutils.EncodingProfile you can use load it from a GstPbutils.EncodingTarget using the following syntaxes \nor \nEncoding targets are serialized in a KeyFile like files. \nGST_DATADIR gstreamer GST_API_VERSION encoding profile HOME gstreamer GST_API_VERSION encoding profile \nThere also is a GST_ENCODING_TARGET_PATH environment variable defining a list of folder containing encoding target files. \n"});
