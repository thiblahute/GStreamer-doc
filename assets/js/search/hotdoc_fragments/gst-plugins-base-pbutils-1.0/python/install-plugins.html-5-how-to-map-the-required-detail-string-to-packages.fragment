This could be a hardcoded list of mappings for example or be part of the packaging system metadata. \nGStreamer plugin files can be introspected for this information. The gst inspect utility has a special command line option that will output information similar to what is required. For example gst inspect print plugin auto install info path to libgstvorbis.so should output something along the lines ofdecoder audio x vorbis element vorbisdecelement vorbisencelement vorbisparse element vorbistag encoder audio x vorbis \nNote that in the encoder and decoder case the introspected caps can be more complex with additional fields e.g. audio mpeg mpegversion int so they will not always exactly match the caps wanted by the application. It is up to the installer to deal with this either by doing proper caps intersection using the GStreamer Gst.Caps API or by only taking into account the media type \nAnother potential source of problems are plugins such as ladspa or libvisual where the list of elements depends on the installed ladspa libvisual plugins at the time. This is also up to the distribution to handle but usually not relevant for playback applications \n"});
