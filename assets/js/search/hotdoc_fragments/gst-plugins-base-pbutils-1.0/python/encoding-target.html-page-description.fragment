Each added profile must have a unique name within the profile. \nThe target will steal a reference to the profile. If you wish to use the profile after calling this method you should increase its reference count. \nSaves the target to the provided file location. \nList all available GstPbutils.EncodingTarget for the specified category or all categories if categoryname is None. \nLists all GstPbutils.EncodingTarget categories present on disk. \nGstPbutils.EncodingTarget category for device specific targets. The name of the target will usually be the constructor and model of the device and that target will contain GstPbutils.EncodingProfile suitable for that device. \nGstPbutils.EncodingTarget category for online services. The name of the target will usually be the name of the online service and that target will contain GstPbutils.EncodingProfile suitable for that online service. \nGstPbutils.EncodingTarget category for storage archiving and editing targets. Those targets can be lossless and or provide very fast random access content. The name of the target will usually be the container type or editing target and that target will contain GstPbutils.EncodingProfile suitable for editing or storage. \nGstPbutils.EncodingTarget category for recording and capture. Targets within this category are optimized for low latency encoding. \nGstPbutils.EncodingTarget category for file extensions. The name of the target will be the name of the file extensions possible for a particular target. Those targets are defining like default formats usually used for a particular file extension. \n"});
