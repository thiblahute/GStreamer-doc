The fields present in restriction caps are properties of the raw stream that is before encoding such as height and width for video and depth and sampling rate for audio. This property does not make sense for muxers. See GstPbutils.EncodingProfile.get_restriction for more details. \nTo force a video stream to be encoded with a Full HD resolution using WebM as the container format VP8 as the video codec and Vorbis as the audio codec you should use \nNOTE Make sure to enclose into quotes to avoid to be reinterpreted by the shell. \nIn the case you are using encoder types the following is also possible \n"});
