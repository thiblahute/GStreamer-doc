The top level profiles are commonly GstPbutils.EncodingContainerProfile s which contains a user readable name and description along with which container format to use These in turn reference one or more GstPbutils.EncodingProfile s which indicate which encoding format should be used on each individual streams. \nGstPbutils.EncodingProfile s can be provided to the encodebin element which will take care of selecting and setting up the required elements to produce an output stream conforming to the specifications of the profile. \nUnlike other systems the encoding profiles do not specify which Gst.Element to use for the various encoding and muxing steps but instead relies on specifying the format one wishes to use. \nEncoding profiles can be created at runtime by the application or loaded from and saved to file using the GstPbutils.EncodingTarget API. \n"});
