Encoding Targets are basically a higher level of abstraction to define formats for specific target types. Those can define several GstEncodingProfiles with different names for example one for transcoding in full HD another one for low res etc.. which are defined in the same encoding target. \nBasically if you wan to encode a stream to send it to say youtube you should have a Youtube encoding target defined in the online service category. \n"});
