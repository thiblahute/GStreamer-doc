For a normal package build into the usr prefix this will usually default to usr libexec gst install plugins helper or usr lib gst install plugins helper. \nVendors distros who want to support GStreamer plugin installation should either provide such a helper script application or use the configure option with install plugins helper path to installer to make GStreamer call an installer of their own directly. \nIt is strongly recommended that vendors provide a small helper application as interlocutor to the real installer though even more so if command line argument munging is required to transform the command line arguments passed by GStreamer to the helper application into arguments that are understood by the real installer. \nThe helper application path defined at compile time can be overriden at runtime by setting the GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_HELPER environment variable. This can be useful for testing debugging purposes. \n"});
