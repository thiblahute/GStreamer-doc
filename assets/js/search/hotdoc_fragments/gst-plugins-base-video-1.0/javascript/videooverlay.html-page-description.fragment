If this is not used or not supported the video will fill the area of the window set as the overlay to By specifying the rectangle the video can be overlayed to a specific region of that window only. After setting the new rectangle one should call GstVideo.VideoOverlay.prototype.expose to force a redraw. To unset the region pass for the width and height parameters. \nThis method is needed for non fullscreen video overlay in UI toolkits that do not support subwindows. \nThis will call the video overlay s set_window_handle method.
