The pixels from source have each component interleaved and will be packed into the planes in data. \nThis function operates on pack_lines lines meaning that src should contain at least pack_lines lines with a stride of sstride and y should be a multiple of pack_lines. \nSubsampled formats will use the horizontally and vertically cosited component from the source. Subsampling should be performed before packing. \nBecause this function does not have a x coordinate it is not possible to pack pixels starting from an unaligned position. For tiled images this means that packing should start from a tile coordinate. For subsampled formats this means that a complete pixel needs to be packed. \n"});
