Sequence numbers are monotonically increasing and unique for overlay compositions and rectangles meaning there will never be a rectangle with the same sequence number as a composition \nUsing the sequence number of a rectangle as an indicator for changed pixel data of a rectangle is dangereous. Some API calls like e.g. GstVideo.VideoOverlayRectangle.prototype.set_global_alpha automatically update the per rectangle sequence number which is misleading for renderers consumers that handle global alpha themselves. For them the pixel data returned by gst_video_overlay_rectangle_get_pixels_ wont be different for different global alpha values. In this case a renderer could also use the GstBuffer pointers as a hint for changed pixel data. \nParameters \na GstVideo.VideoOverlayRectangle \nthe sequence number of rectangle \n"});
