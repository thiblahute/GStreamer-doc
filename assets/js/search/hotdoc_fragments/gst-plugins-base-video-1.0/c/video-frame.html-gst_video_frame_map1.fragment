You can then use accessor macros such as GST_VIDEO_FRAME_COMP_DATA GST_VIDEO_FRAME_PLANE_DATA GST_VIDEO_FRAME_COMP_STRIDE GST_VIDEO_FRAME_PLANE_STRIDE etc. to get to the pixels. \nAll video planes of buffer will be mapped and the pointers will be set in frame data. \nThe purpose of this function is to make it easy for you to get to the video pixels in a generic way without you having to worry too much about details such as whether the video data is allocated in one contiguous memory chunk or multiple memory chunks e.g. one for each plane or if custom strides and custom plane offsets are used or not as signalled by GstVideoMeta on each buffer This function will just fill the GstVideoFrame structure with the right values and if you use the accessor macros everything will just work and you can access the data easily. It also maps the underlying memory chunks for you. \n"});
