This is the number of planes the pixel layout is organized in in memory. The number of planes can be less than the number of components e.g. Y U V A or R G B A when multiple components are packed into one plane. \nExamples RGB RGBx RGBA plane components I420 planes components NV21 NV12 planes components. \nGeneric caps string for video for use in pad templates. \nGstVideoFormatFlags flags \nGstVideoFormatFlags \nguint shift \nthe number of bits to shift away to get the component data \nguint n_planes \nthe number of planes for this format. The number of planes can be less than the amount of components when multiple components are packed into one plane. \nGstVideoFormatUnpack unpack_func \nan unpack function for this format \ngint pack_lines \nthe amount of lines that will be packed \nWhen the source has a smaller depth than the target format set the least significant bits of the target to This is likely sightly faster but less accurate. When this flag is not specified the most significant bits of the source are duplicated in the least significant bits of the destination. \nGST_VIDEO_PACK_FLAG_INTERLACED \nThe source is interlaced. The unpacked format will be interlaced as well with each line containing information from alternating fields. Since \n"});
