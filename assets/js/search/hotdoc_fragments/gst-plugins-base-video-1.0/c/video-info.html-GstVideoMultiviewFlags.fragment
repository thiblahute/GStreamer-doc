This flag is used for overriding input layout interpretation by adjusting pixel aspect ratio. For side by side column interleaved or checkerboard packings the pixel width will be doubled. For row interleaved and top bottom encodings pixel height will be doubled. \nGST_VIDEO_MULTIVIEW_FLAGS_MIXED_MONO \nThe video stream contains both mono and multiview portions signalled on each buffer by the absence or presence of the GST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_MULTIPLE_VIEW buffer flag. \n"});
