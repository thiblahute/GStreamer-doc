Allows to attach private data by the subclass to frames. \nIf a user_data was previously set then the previous set notify will be called before the user_data is replaced. \nChecks whether the given flag is set \nThis macro sets the given bits \nThis macro usets the given bits. \nTests if the buffer should only be decoded but not sent downstream. \nSets the buffer to not be sent downstream. \nDecoder implementation can use this if they have frames that are not meant to be displayed. \nEncoder implementation can safely ignore this field. \nTests if the frame is a synchronization point like a keyframe \nDecoder implementations can use this to detect keyframes. \nSets the frame to be a synchronization point like a keyframe \nEncoder implementations should set this accordingly. \nDecoder implementing parsing features should set this when they detect such a synchronization point. \nTests if the frame must be encoded as a keyframe. Applies only to frames provided to encoders. Decoders can safely ignore this field. \nTests if encoder should output stream headers before outputting the resulting encoded buffer for the given frame. \nApplies only to frames provided to encoders. Decoders can safely ignore this field. \nguint32 decode_frame_number \nguint32 presentation_frame_number \nGstClockTime dts \nDecoding timestamp \nGstBuffer input_buffer \nthe input GstBuffer that created this frame.
