The number of commands passed must be equal to n_commands. \nSends a mouse event to the navigation interface. Mouse event coordinates are sent relative to the display space of the related output area. This is usually the size in pixels of the window associated with the element implementing the GstNavigation interface. \nInspect a GstEvent and return the GstNavigationEventType of the event or GST_NAVIGATION_EVENT_INVALID if the event is not a GstNavigation event. \nInspect a GstNavigation command event and retrieve the enum value of the associated command. \nRetrieve the details of either a GstNavigation mouse button press event or a mouse button release event. Determine which type the event is using gst_navigation_event_get_type to retrieve the GstNavigationEventType. \nInspect a GstNavigation mouse movement event and extract the coordinates of the event. \nCheck a bus message to see if it is a GstNavigation event and return the GstNavigationMessageType identifying the type of the message if so. \nCreates a new GstNavigation message with type GST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_ANGLES_CHANGED for notifying an application that the current angle or current number of angles available in a multiangle video has changed. \nCreates a new GstNavigation message with type GST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_COMMANDS_CHANGED \nCreates a new GstNavigation message with type GST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_EVENT. \nCreates a new GstNavigation message with type GST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_MOUSE_OVER. \nParse a GstNavigation message of type GST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_ANGLES_CHANGED and extract the cur_angle and n_angles parameters. \nParse a GstNavigation message of type GST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_EVENT and extract contained GstEvent. The caller must unref the event when done with it. \nParse a GstNavigation message of type GST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_MOUSE_OVER and extract the active inactive flag. If the mouse over event is marked active it indicates that the mouse is over a clickable area. \nInspect a GstQuery and return the GstNavigationQueryType associated with it if it is a GstNavigation query. \nCreate a new GstNavigation angles query. When executed it will query the pipeline for the set of currently available angles which may be greater than one in a multiangle video. \nCreate a new GstNavigation commands query. When executed it will query the pipeline for the set of currently available commands. \nParse the current angle number in the GstNavigation angles query into the guint pointed to by the cur_angle variable and the number of available angles into the guint pointed to by the n_angles variable. \nParse the number of commands in the GstNavigation commands query. \nParse the GstNavigation command query and retrieve the nth command from it into cmd. If the list contains less elements than nth cmd will be set to GST_NAVIGATION_COMMAND_INVALID. \nSet the GstNavigation angles query result field in query. \nSet the GstNavigation command query result fields in query. The number of commands passed must be equal to n_commands. \nAn invalid command entry \nGST_NAVIGATION_COMMAND_MENU1 \nActivate click the currently selected button in a menu if such a button exists. \nGST_NAVIGATION_COMMAND_PREV_ANGLE \nSwitch to the previous angle in a multiangle feature. \nGST_NAVIGATION_COMMAND_NEXT_ANGLE \nSwitch to the next angle in a multiangle feature. \nA key press event. Use gst_navigation_event_parse_key_event to extract the details from the event. \nGST_NAVIGATION_EVENT_KEY_RELEASE \nA key release event. Use gst_navigation_event_parse_key_event to extract the details from the event. \nGST_NAVIGATION_EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON_PRESS \nA mouse button press event. Use gst_navigation_event_parse_mouse_button_event to extract the details from the event. \nGST_NAVIGATION_EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON_RELEASE \nA mouse button release event. Use gst_navigation_event_parse_mouse_button_event to extract the details from the event. \nGST_NAVIGATION_EVENT_MOUSE_MOVE \nA mouse movement event. Use gst_navigation_event_parse_mouse_move_event to extract the details from the event. \nGST_NAVIGATION_EVENT_COMMAND \nReturned from gst_navigation_message_get_type when the passed message is not a navigation message. \nGST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_MOUSE_OVER \nSent when the mouse moves over or leaves a clickable region of the output such as a DVD menu button. \nGST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_COMMANDS_CHANGED \nSent when the set of available commands changes and should re queried by interested applications. \nGST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_ANGLES_CHANGED \nSent when display angles in a multi angle feature such as a multiangle DVD change either angles have appeared or disappeared. \nGST_NAVIGATION_MESSAGE_EVENT \n"});
