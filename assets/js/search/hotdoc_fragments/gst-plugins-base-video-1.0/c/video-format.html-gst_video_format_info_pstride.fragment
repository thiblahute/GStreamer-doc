This is the amount of bytes to the pixel immediately to the right so basically bytes from one pixel to the next. When bits the stride is expressed in bits. \nExamples for bit RGB the pixel stride would be bytes while it would be bytes for RGBx or ARGB and bytes for ARGB64 or AYUV64. For planar formats such as I420 the pixel stride is usually For YUY2 it would be bytes. \ninfo \na GstVideoFormatInfo \nc \nthe component index \n"});
