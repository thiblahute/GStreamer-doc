This method only applies to raw video buffers at the moment. Specific view identification is via the GstVideoMultiviewMeta and GstVideoMeta s on raw video buffers. \nMultiple views are provided as separate GstMemory framebuffers attached to each GstBuffer described by the GstVideoMultiviewMeta and GstVideoMeta s \n"});
