The layout in case of ARGB of the components in memory is B G R A on little endian platforms corresponding to GST_VIDEO_FORMAT_BGRA and A R G B on big endian platforms corresponding to GST_VIDEO_FORMAT_ARGB In other words pixels are treated as bit words and the lowest bits then contain the blue component value and the highest bits contain the alpha component value. Unless specified in the flags the RGB values are non premultiplied. This is the format that is used by most hardware and also many rendering libraries such as Cairo for example. The pixel data buffer must have GstVideoMeta set. \n"});
