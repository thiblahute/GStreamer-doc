In mixed interlace mode this flags specifies if the frame is interlaced or progressive. \nGstVideo.VideoBufferFlags.tff \nIf the Gst.Buffer is interlaced then only the first field as defined by the GST_VIDEO_BUFFER_TFF flag setting is to be displayed. \nGstVideo.VideoBufferFlags.multiple_view \nThe Gst.Buffer contains one or more specific views such as left or right eye view. This flags is set on any buffer that contains non mono content even for streams that contain only a single viewpoint.
