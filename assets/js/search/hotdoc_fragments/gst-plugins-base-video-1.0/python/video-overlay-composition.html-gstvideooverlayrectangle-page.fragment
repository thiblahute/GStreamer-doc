The actual blending of the overlay can then be done by e.g. the video sink that processes these non raw buffers. \nit can also be used to blend overlay rectangles on top of raw video buffers thus consolidating blending functionality for raw video in one place. \nTogether this allows existing overlay elements to easily handle raw and non raw video as input in without major changes once the overlays have been put into a GstOverlayComposition object anyway for raw video the overlay can just use the blending function to blend the data on top of the video and for surface buffers it can just attach them to the buffer and let the sink render the overlays. \n"});
