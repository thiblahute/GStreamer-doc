The pixels from source have each component interleaved and will be packed into the planes in data. \nThis function operates on pack_lines lines meaning that src should contain at least pack_lines lines with a stride of sstride and y should be a multiple of pack_lines. \nSubsampled formats will use the horizontally and vertically cosited component from the source. Subsampling should be performed before packing. \nBecause this function does not have a x coordinate it is not possible to pack pixels starting from an unaligned position. For tiled images this means that packing should start from a tile coordinate. For subsampled formats this means that a complete pixel needs to be packed. \ninfo \na GstVideo.VideoFormatInfo \nflags \nflags to control the packing \nsrc \na source array \nsstride \nthe source array stride \ndata \npointers to the destination data planes \nstride \nstrides of the destination planes \nchroma_site \nthe chroma siting of the target when subsampled not used \ny \nthe y position in the image to pack to \nwidth \nthe amount of pixels to pack. \n\n"});
