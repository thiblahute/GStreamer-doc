Returns true for both upstream and downstream force key unit events. \nCreates a new downstream force key unit event. A downstream force key unit event can be sent down the pipeline to request downstream elements to produce a key unit. A downstream force key unit event must also be sent when handling an upstream force key unit event to notify downstream that the latter has been handled. \nTo parse an event created by GstVideo.video_event_new_downstream_force_key_unit use GstVideo.video_event_parse_downstream_force_key_unit. \nCreates a new Still Frame event. If in_still is True then the event represents the start of a still frame sequence. If it is False then the event ends a still frame sequence. \nTo parse an event created by GstVideo.video_event_new_still_frame use GstVideo.video_event_parse_still_frame. \nCreates a new upstream force key unit event. An upstream force key unit event can be sent to request upstream elements to produce a key unit. \nrunning_time can be set to request a new key unit at a specific running_time. If set to GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE upstream elements will produce a new key unit as soon as possible. \nTo parse an event created by GstVideo.video_event_new_downstream_force_key_unit use GstVideo.video_event_parse_downstream_force_key_unit. \nGet timestamp stream time running time all headers and count in the force key unit event. See GstVideo.video_event_new_downstream_force_key_unit for a full description of the downstream force key unit event. \nrunning_time will be adjusted for any pad offsets of pads it was passing through. \nParse a Gst.Event identify if it is a Still Frame event and return the still frame state from the event if it is. If the event represents the start of a still frame the in_still variable will be set to TRUE otherwise FALSE. It is OK to pass NULL for the in_still variable order to just check whether the event is a valid still frame event. \nCreate a still frame event using GstVideo.video_event_new_still_frame \nGet running time all headers and count in the force key unit event. See GstVideo.video_event_new_upstream_force_key_unit for a full description of the upstream force key unit event. \nCreate an upstream force key unit event using GstVideo.video_event_new_upstream_force_key_unit \nrunning_time will be adjusted for any pad offsets of pads it was passing through. \n"});
