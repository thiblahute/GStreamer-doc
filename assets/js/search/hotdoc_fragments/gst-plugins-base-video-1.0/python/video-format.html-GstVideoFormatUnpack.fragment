The pixels will be unpacked into dest with each component interleaved as per info s unpack_format which will usually be one of GstVideo.VideoFormat.argb GstVideo.VideoFormat.ayuv GstVideo.VideoFormat.argb64 or GstVideo.VideoFormat.ayuv64 depending on the format to unpack. dest should at least be big enough to hold width bytes_per_pixel bytes where bytes_per_pixel relates to the unpack format and will usually be either or depending on the unpack format. bytes_per_pixel will be the same as the pixel stride for plane for the above formats. \nFor subsampled formats the components will be duplicated in the destination array. Reconstruction of the missing components can be performed in a separate step after unpacking. \nParameters \na GstVideo.VideoFormatInfo \nflags to control the unpacking \na destination array \npointers to the data planes \nstrides of the planes \nthe x position in the image to start from \nthe y position in the image to start from \nthe amount of pixels to unpack. \n"});
