It can be used by elements that provide a property to override the multiview interpretation of a video stream when the video doesn t contain any markers. \nThis enum is used for example on playbin to re interpret a played video stream as a stereoscopic video. The individual enum values are equivalent to and have the same value as the matching GstVideo.VideoMultiviewMode. \n"});
