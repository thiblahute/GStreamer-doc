It can be used by elements that provide a property to override the multiview interpretation of a video stream when the video doesn t contain any markers. \nThis enum is used for example on playbin to re interpret a played video stream as a stereoscopic video. The individual enum values are equivalent to and have the same value as the matching GstVideo.VideoMultiviewMode. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.none \nA special value indicating no frame packing info. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.mono \nAll frames are monoscopic. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.left \nAll frames represent a left eye view. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.right \nAll frames represent a right eye view. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.side_by_side \nLeft and right eye views are provided in the left and right half of the frame respectively. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.side_by_side_quincunx \nLeft and right eye views are provided in the left and right half of the frame but have been sampled using quincunx method with half pixel offset between the views. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.column_interleaved \nAlternating vertical columns of pixels represent the left and right eye view respectively. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.row_interleaved \nAlternating horizontal rows of pixels represent the left and right eye view respectively. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.top_bottom \nThe top half of the frame contains the left eye and the bottom half the right eye. \nGstVideo.VideoMultiviewFramePacking.checkerboard \nPixels are arranged with alternating pixels representing left and right eye views in a checkerboard fashion. \n"});
