Elements are required to make use of Gst.Context to share and propogate a GstGL.GLDisplay. \nThere are a number of environment variables that influence the choice of platform and window system specific functionality. \nCertain window systems require a special function to be called to initialize threading support. As this GStreamer GL library does not preclude concurrent access to the windowing system it is strongly advised that applications ensure that threading support has been initialized before any other toolkit library functionality is accessed. Failure to do so could result in sudden application abortion during execution. The most notably example of such a function is X11 s XInitThreads. \n"});
