It will produce a perfect stream that matches the source pad s framerate. \nThe correction is performed by dropping and duplicating frames no fancy algorithm is used to interpolate frames yet \nBy default the element will simply negotiate the same framerate on its source and sink pad. \nThis operation is useful to link to elements that require a perfect stream. Typical examples are formats that do not store timestamps for video frames but only store a framerate like Ogg and AVI. \nA conversion to a specific framerate can be forced by using filtered caps on the source pad. \nThe properties GstVideoRate in GstVideoRate out GstVideoRate duplicate and GstVideoRate drop can be read to obtain information about number of input frames output frames dropped frames i.e. the number of unused input frames and duplicated frames i.e. the number of times an input frame was duplicated beside being used normally \nAn input stream that needs no adjustments will thus never have dropped or duplicated frames. \nWhen the GstVideoRate silent property is set to FALSE a GObject property notification will be emitted whenever one of the GstVideoRate duplicate or GstVideoRate drop values changes. This can potentially cause performance degradation. Note that property notification will happen from the streaming thread so applications should be prepared for this. \nThe property GstVideoRate rate allows the modification of video speed by a certain factor. It must not be confused with framerate. Think of rate as speed and framerate as flow. \nDecode a video file and adjust the framerate to fps before playing. To create a test Ogg Theora file refer to the documentation of theoraenc. \nCapture video from a V4L device and adjust the stream to fps before encoding to Ogg Theora. \nDecode a video file and save a snapshot every seconds as consecutively numbered jpeg file. \nAuthors Wim Taymans \nClassification Filter Effect Video \nRank \nPlugin libgstvideorate.so \n"});
