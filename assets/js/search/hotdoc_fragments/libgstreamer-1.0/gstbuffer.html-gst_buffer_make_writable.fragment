fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/gstbuffer.html#gst_buffer_make_writable", "fragment": "gst_buffer_make_writable \nReturns a writable copy of buf. If the source buffer is already writable this will simply return the same buffer. \nUse this function to ensure that a buffer can be safely modified before making changes to it including changing the metadata such as PTS DTS. \nIf the reference count of the source buffer buf is exactly one the caller is the sole owner and this function will return the buffer object unchanged. \nIf there is more than one reference on the object a copy will be made using gst_buffer_copy. The passed in buf will be unreffed in that case and the caller will now own a reference to the new returned buffer object. Note that this just copies the buffer structure itself the underlying memory is not copied if it can be shared amongst multiple buffers. \nIn short this function unrefs the buf in the argument and refs the buffer that it returns. Don t access the argument after calling this function unless you have an additional reference to it. \nParameters \na GstBuffer \na writable buffer which may or may not be the same as buf \n"});
