If temp is NULL an allocation will take place. temp should have at least the same amount of memory allocated as xy i.e. nsizeof GstClockTime \nThis function assumes x y values with reasonable large differences between them. It will not calculate the exact results if the differences between neighbouring values are too small due to not being able to represent sub integer values during the calculations. \nParameters \nPairs of x y values \nTemporary scratch space used by the function \nnumber of x y pairs \nnumerator of calculated slope \ndenominator of calculated slope \nOffset at Y axis \nOffset at X axis \nR squared \nTRUE if the linear regression was successfully calculated \nSince \n"});
