This behaviour can be disabled using this function. \nIt is important that all messages on the bus are handled when the automatic flushing is disabled else memory leaks will be introduced. \nMT safe. \nParameters \na GstPipeline \nwhether or not to automatically flush the bus when the pipeline goes from READY to NULL state \n"});
