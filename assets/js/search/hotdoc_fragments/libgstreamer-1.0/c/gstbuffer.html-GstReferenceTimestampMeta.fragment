These are generally not according to the pipeline clock and could be e.g. the NTP timestamp when the media was captured. \nThe reference is stored as a GstCaps in reference. Examples of valid references would be timestamp x drivername stream for timestamps that are locally generated by some driver named drivername when generating the stream e.g. based on a frame counter or timestamp x ntp host pool.ntp.org port for timestamps based on a specific NTP server. \n"});
