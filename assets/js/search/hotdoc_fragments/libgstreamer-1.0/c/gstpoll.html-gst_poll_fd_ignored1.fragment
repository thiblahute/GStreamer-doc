fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/c/gstpoll.html#gst_poll_fd_ignored1", "fragment": "gst_poll_fd_ignored \nMark fd as ignored so that the next call to gst_poll_wait will yield the same result for fd as last time. This function must be called if no operation read write recv send etc. will be performed on fd before the next call to gst_poll_wait. \nThe reason why this is needed is because the underlying implementation might not allow querying the fd more than once between calls to one of the re enabling operations. \nParameters \na file descriptor set. \na file descriptor. \n"});
