This function will try to set the requested state by going through all the intermediary states and calling the class s state change function for each. \nThis function can return GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC in which case the element will perform the remainder of the state change asynchronously in another thread. An application can use gst_element_get_state to wait for the completion of the state change or it can wait for a GST_MESSAGE_ASYNC_DONE or GST_MESSAGE_STATE_CHANGED on the bus. \nState changes to GST_STATE_READY or GST_STATE_NULL never return GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC. \n"});
