It is possible to make this wait be controlled by specifying TRUE for the controllable flag when creating the set or later calling gst_poll_set_controllable \nNew file descriptors are added to the set using gst_poll_add_fd and removed using gst_poll_remove_fd. Controlling which file descriptors should be waited for to become readable and or writable are done using gst_poll_fd_ctl_read and gst_poll_fd_ctl_write. \nUse gst_poll_wait to wait for the file descriptors to actually become readable and or writable or to timeout if no file descriptor is available in time. The wait can be controlled by calling gst_poll_restart and gst_poll_set_flushing. \nOnce the file descriptor set has been waited for one can use gst_poll_fd_has_closed to see if the file descriptor has been closed gst_poll_fd_has_error to see if it has generated an error gst_poll_fd_can_read to see if it is possible to read from the file descriptor and gst_poll_fd_can_write to see if it is possible to write to it. \n"});
