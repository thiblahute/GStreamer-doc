Audio processing GstElement objects will use this rate to sub divide their processing loop and call gst_object_sync_values inbetween. The length of the processing segment should be up to control rate nanoseconds. \nIf the object is not under property control this will return GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE. This allows the element to avoid the sub dividing. \nThe control rate is not expected to change if the element is in GST_STATE_PAUSED or GST_STATE_PLAYING. \n"});
