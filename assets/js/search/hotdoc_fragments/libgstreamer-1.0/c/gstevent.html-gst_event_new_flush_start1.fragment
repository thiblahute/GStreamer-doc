The flush start event can be sent upstream and downstream and travels out of bounds with the dataflow. \nIt marks pads as being flushing and will make them return GST_FLOW_FLUSHING when used for data flow with gst_pad_push gst_pad_chain gst_pad_get_range and gst_pad_pull_range. Any event except a GST_EVENT_FLUSH_STOP received on a flushing pad will return FALSE immediately. \nElements should unlock any blocking functions and exit their streaming functions as fast as possible when this event is received. \nThis event is typically generated after a seek to flush out all queued data in the pipeline so that the new media is played as soon as possible. \n\na new flush start event. \n"});
