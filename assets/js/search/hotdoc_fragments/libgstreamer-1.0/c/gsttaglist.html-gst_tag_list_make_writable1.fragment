If on the other hand there is more than one reference on the object a new taglist object will be returned which will be a copy of taglist The caller s reference on taglist will be removed and instead the caller will own a reference to the returned object. \nIn short this function unrefs the taglist in the argument and refs the taglist that it returns. Don t access the argument after calling this function. See also gst_tag_list_ref. \n"});
