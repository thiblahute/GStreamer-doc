Pads from the child elements can be ghosted to the bin see GstGhostPad. This makes the bin look like any other elements and enables creation of higher level abstraction elements. \nA new GstBin is created with gst_bin_new. Use a GstPipeline instead if you want to create a toplevel bin because a normal bin doesn t have a bus or handle clock distribution of its own. \nAfter the bin has been created you will typically add elements to it with gst_bin_add. You can remove elements with gst_bin_remove. \nAn element can be retrieved from a bin with gst_bin_get_by_name using the elements name. gst_bin_get_by_name_recurse_up is mainly used for internal purposes and will query the parent bins when the element is not found in the current bin. \nAn iterator of elements in a bin can be retrieved with gst_bin_iterate_elements. Various other iterators exist to retrieve the elements in a bin. \ngst_object_unref is used to drop your reference to the bin. \nThe element added signal is fired whenever a new element is added to the bin. Likewise the element removed signal is fired whenever an element is removed from the bin. \n"});
