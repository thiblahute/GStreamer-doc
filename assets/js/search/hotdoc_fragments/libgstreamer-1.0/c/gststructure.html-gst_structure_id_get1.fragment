Variable arguments should be in the form field id quark field type as a GType pointer s to a variable s to hold the return value s The last variable argument should be NULL technically it should be a quark but we require NULL so compilers that support it can check for the NULL terminator and warn if it s not there \nThis function is just like gst_structure_get only that it is slightly more efficient since it saves the string to quark lookup in the global quark hashtable. \nFor refcounted mini objects you will receive a new reference which you must release with a suitable _unref when no longer needed. For strings and boxed types you will receive a copy which you will need to release with either g_free or the suitable function for the boxed type. \nParameters \na GstStructure \nthe quark of the first field to read \nvariable arguments \nFALSE if there was a problem reading any of the fields e.g. because the field requested did not exist or was of a type other than the type specified otherwise TRUE. \n"});
