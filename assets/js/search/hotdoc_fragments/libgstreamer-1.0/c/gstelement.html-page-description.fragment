It is not guaranteed that linking the pads will work though it should work in most cases. \nThis function will first attempt to find a compatible unlinked ALWAYS pad and if none can be found it will request a compatible REQUEST pad by looking at the templates of element. \nRetrieves a pad template from element that is compatible with compattempl. Pads from compatible templates can be linked together. \nGets the context with context_type set on the element or NULL. \nRetrieves an iterator of element s sink pads. \nThe order of pads returned by the iterator will be the order in which the pads were added to the element. \nLinks the two named pads of the source and destination elements. Side effect is that if one of the pads has no parent it becomes a child of the parent of the other element. If they have different parents the link fails. If caps is not NULL makes sure that the caps of the link is a subset of caps. \nPost an error warning or info message on the bus from inside an element. \ntype must be of GST_MESSAGE_ERROR GST_MESSAGE_WARNING or GST_MESSAGE_INFO. \nMakes the element free the previously requested pad as obtained with gst_element_request_pad. \nThis does not unref the pad. If the pad was created by using gst_element_request_pad gst_element_release_request_pad needs to be followed by gst_object_unref to free the pad. \nMT safe. \nTries to change the state of the element to the same as its parent. If this function returns FALSE the state of element is undefined. \nGList padtemplates \na GList of GstPadTemplate \nguint32 pad_templ_cookie \nchanged whenever the padtemplates change \ngpointer _gst_reserved \nSet key with value as metadata in klass. \nAdds a padtemplate to an element class. This is mainly used in the _class_init functions of classes. If a pad template with the same name as an already existing one is added the old one is replaced by the new one. \nSet key with value as metadata in klass. \nSame as gst_element_class_add_metadata but value must be a static string or an inlined string as it will not be copied. GStreamer plugins will be made resident once loaded so this function can be used even from dynamically loaded plugins. \nAdds a pad template to an element class based on the static pad template templ. This is mainly used in the _class_init functions of element implementations. If a pad template with the same name already exists the old one is replaced by the new one. \nGet metadata with key in klass. \nRetrieves a padtemplate from element_class with the given name. \nIf you use this function in the GInstanceInitFunc of an object class that has subclasses make sure to pass the g_class parameter of the GInstanceInitFunc here. \nRetrieves a list of the pad templates associated with element_class. The list must not be modified by the calling code. \nIf you use this function in the GInstanceInitFunc of an object class that has subclasses make sure to pass the g_class parameter of the GInstanceInitFunc here. \nSets the detailed information for a GstElementClass. \nThis function is for use in _class_init functions only. \nSets the detailed information for a GstElementClass. \nThis function is for use in _class_init functions only. \nSame as gst_element_class_set_metadata but longname classification description and author must be static strings or inlined strings as they will not be copied. GStreamer plugins will be made resident once loaded so this function can be used even from dynamically loaded plugins. \nUtility function that elements can use in case they encountered a fatal data processing error. The pipeline will post an error message and the application will be requested to stop further media processing. \nUtility function that elements can use in case they encountered a non fatal data processing problem. The pipeline will post a warning message and the application will be informed. \nthe element can provide a clock \nGST_ELEMENT_FLAG_REQUIRE_CLOCK \nthe element requires a clock \nGST_ELEMENT_FLAG_INDEXABLE \n"});
