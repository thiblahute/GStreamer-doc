The function typically processes the data contained in the buffer list and either consumes the data or passes it on to the internally linked pad s \nThe implementer of this function receives a refcount to list and should gst_buffer_list_unref when the list is no longer needed. \nWhen a chainlist function detects an error in the data stream it must post an error on the bus and return an appropriate GstFlowReturn value. \nParameters \nthe sink GstPad that performed the chain. \nthe parent of pad. If the GST_PAD_FLAG_NEED_PARENT flag is set parent is guaranteed to be not NULL and remain valid during the execution of this function. \nthe GstBufferList that is chained not NULL. \nGST_FLOW_OK for success \n"});
