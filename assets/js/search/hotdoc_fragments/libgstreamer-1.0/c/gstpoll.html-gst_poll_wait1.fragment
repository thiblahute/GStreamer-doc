A timeout of GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE waits forever. \nFor GstPoll objects created with gst_poll_new this function can only be called from a single thread at a time. If called from multiple threads will be returned with errno set to EPERM. \nThis is not true for timer GstPoll objects created with gst_poll_new_timer where it is allowed to have multiple threads waiting simultaneously. \n"});
