One would use this macro to export a plugin so that it can be used by other applications. \nThe macro uses a define named PACKAGE for the GstPluginDesc source field. When using autoconf this is usually set automatically via the AC_INIT macro and set in config.h. If you are not using autoconf you will need to define PACKAGE yourself and set it to a short mnemonic string identifying your application package e.g. someapp or my plugins foo. \nIf defined the GST_PACKAGE_RELEASE_DATETIME will also be used for the GstPluginDesc release_datetime field. \n"});
