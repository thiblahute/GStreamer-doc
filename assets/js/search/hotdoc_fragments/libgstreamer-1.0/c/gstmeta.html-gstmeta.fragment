The structure defines the API of the metadata and should be accessible to all elements using the metadata. \nA metadata API is registered with gst_meta_api_type_register which takes a name for the metadata API and some tags associated with the metadata. With gst_meta_api_type_has_tag one can check if a certain metadata API contains a given tag. \nMultiple implementations of a metadata API can be registered. To implement a metadata API gst_meta_register should be used. This function takes all parameters needed to create free and transform metadata along with the size of the metadata. The function returns a GstMetaInfo structure that contains the information for the implementation of the API. \nA specific implementation can be retrieved by name with gst_meta_get_info. \nSee GstBuffer for how the metadata can be added retrieved and removed from buffers. \n"});
