The structure is not copied caps becomes the owner of structure. \nCalls the provided function once for each structure and caps feature in the GstCaps. In contrast to gst_caps_foreach the function may modify the structure and features. In contrast to gst_caps_filter_and_map_in_place the structure and features are removed from the caps if FALSE is returned from the function. The caps must be mutable. \nA given GstCaps structure is always compatible with another if every media format that is in the first is also contained in the second. That is caps1 is a subset of caps2. \nChecks if structure is a subset of caps. See gst_caps_is_subset for more information. \nAppends structure with features to caps if its not already expressed by caps. \n"});
