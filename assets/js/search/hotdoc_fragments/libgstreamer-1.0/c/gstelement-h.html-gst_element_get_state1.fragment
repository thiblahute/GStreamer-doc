If the element completes the state change or goes into an error this function returns immediately with a return value of GST_STATE_CHANGE_SUCCESS or GST_STATE_CHANGE_FAILURE respectively. \nFor elements that did not return GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC this function returns the current and pending state immediately. \nThis function returns GST_STATE_CHANGE_NO_PREROLL if the element successfully changed its state but is not able to provide data yet. This mostly happens for live sources that only produce data in GST_STATE_PLAYING. While the state change return is equivalent to GST_STATE_CHANGE_SUCCESS it is returned to the application to signal that some sink elements might not be able to complete their state change because an element is not producing data to complete the preroll. When setting the element to playing the preroll will complete and playback will start. \n"});
