The flush stop event can be sent upstream and downstream and travels serialized with the dataflow. It is typically sent after sending a FLUSH_START event to make the pads accept data again. \nElements can process this event synchronized with the dataflow since the preceding FLUSH_START event stopped the dataflow. \nThis event is typically generated to complete a seek and to resume dataflow. \n"});
