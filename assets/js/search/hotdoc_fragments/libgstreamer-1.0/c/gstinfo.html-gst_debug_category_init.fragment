It is not earth shattering if you don t follow these conventions but it would be nice for everyone. \nIf you define a category for a plugin or a feature of it name the category like the feature. So if you wanted to write a filesrc element you would name the category filesrc Use lowercase letters only. If you define more than one category for the same element append an underscore and an identifier to your categories like this filesrc_cache \nIf you create a library or an application using debugging categories use a common prefix followed by an underscore for all your categories. GStreamer uses the GST prefix so GStreamer categories look like GST_STATES Be sure to include uppercase letters. \nParameters \nthe category to initialize. \nthe name of the category. \nthe colors to use for a color representation or for no color. \noptional description of the category. \n"});
