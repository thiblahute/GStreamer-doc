fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/c/gstminiobject.html#gst_mini_object_take1", "fragment": "gst_mini_object_take \nModifies a pointer to point to a new mini object. The modification is done atomically. This version is similar to gst_mini_object_replace except that it does not increase the refcount of newdata and thus takes ownership of newdata. \nEither newdata and the value pointed to by olddata may be NULL. \n"});
