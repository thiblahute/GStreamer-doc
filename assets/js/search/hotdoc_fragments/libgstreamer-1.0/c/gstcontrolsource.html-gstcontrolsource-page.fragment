A control source essentially is a function over time. \nA GstControlSource is used by first getting an instance of a specific control source creating a binding for the control source to the target property of the element and then adding the binding to the element. The binding will convert the data types and value range to fit to the bound property. \nFor implementing a new GstControlSource one has to implement GstControlSourceGetValue and GstControlSourceGetValueArray functions. These are then used by gst_control_source_get_value and gst_control_source_get_value_array to get values for specific timestamps. \n"});
