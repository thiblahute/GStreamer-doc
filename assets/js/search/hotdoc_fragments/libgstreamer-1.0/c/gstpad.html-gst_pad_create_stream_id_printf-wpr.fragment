fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/c/gstpad.html#gst_pad_create_stream_id_printf-wpr", "fragment": "gst_pad_create_stream_id_printf \nCreates a stream id for the source GstPad pad by combining the upstream information with the optional stream_id of the stream of pad. pad must have a parent GstElement and which must have zero or one sinkpad. stream_id can only be NULL if the parent element of pad has only a single source pad. \nThis function generates an unique stream id by getting the upstream stream start event stream ID and appending stream_id to it. If the element has no sinkpad it will generate an upstream stream id by doing an URI query on the element and in the worst case just uses a random number. Source elements that don t implement the URI handler interface should ideally generate a unique deterministic stream id manually instead. \nParameters \nA source GstPad \nParent GstElement of pad \nThe stream id \nparameters for the stream_id format string \nA stream id for pad. g_free after usage. \n"});
