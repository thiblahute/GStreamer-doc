A rate of is the normal speed of the clock. Values bigger than make the clock go faster. \ninternal and external are calibration parameters that arrange that gst_clock_get_time should have been external at internal time internal. This internal time should not be in the future that is it should be less than the value of gst_clock_get_internal_time when this function is called. \nSubsequent calls to gst_clock_get_time will return clock times computed as follows \n\nThis formula is implemented in gst_clock_adjust_unlocked. Of course it tries to do the integer arithmetic as precisely as possible. \nNote that gst_clock_get_time always returns increasing values so when you move the clock backwards gst_clock_get_time will report the previous value until the clock catches up. \nMT safe. \n"});
