If end is not NULL a pointer to the place inside the given string where parsing ended will be returned. \nThe current implementation of serialization will lead to unexpected results when there are nested GstCaps GstStructure deeper than one level. \nFree function gst_structure_free \nCalls the provided function once for each field in the GstStructure. In contrast to gst_structure_foreach the function may modify the fields. In contrast to gst_structure_map_in_place the field is removed from the structure if FALSE is returned from the function. The structure must be mutable. \nFixates a GstStructure by changing the given field_name field to the given target boolean if that field is not fixed yet. \nFixates a GstStructure by changing the given field to the nearest double to target that is a subset of the existing field. \nFixates a GstStructure by changing the given field to the nearest fraction to target_numerator target_denominator that is a subset of the existing field. \nFixates a GstStructure by changing the given field to the nearest integer to target that is a subset of the existing field. \nFixates a GstStructure by changing the given field_name field to the given target string if that field is not fixed yet. \nCheck if structure contains a field named fieldname and with GType type. \nCheck if structure contains a field named field and with GType type. \nRemoves all fields in a GstStructure. \nva_list form of gst_structure_remove_fields. \nSets the parent_refcount field of GstStructure. This field is used to determine whether a structure is mutable or not. This function should only be called by code implementing parent objects of GstStructure as described in the MT Refcounting section of the design documents. \n"});
