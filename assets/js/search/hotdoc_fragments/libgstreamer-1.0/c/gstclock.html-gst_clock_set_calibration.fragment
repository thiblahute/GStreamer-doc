A rate of is the normal speed of the clock. Values bigger than make the clock go faster. \ninternal and external are calibration parameters that arrange that gst_clock_get_time should have been external at internal time internal. This internal time should not be in the future that is it should be less than the value of gst_clock_get_internal_time when this function is called. \nSubsequent calls to gst_clock_get_time will return clock times computed as follows \nThis formula is implemented in gst_clock_adjust_unlocked. Of course it tries to do the integer arithmetic as precisely as possible. \nNote that gst_clock_get_time always returns increasing values so when you move the clock backwards gst_clock_get_time will report the previous value until the clock catches up. \nMT safe. \nParameters \na GstClock to calibrate \na reference internal time \na reference external time \nthe numerator of the rate of the clock relative to its internal time \nthe denominator of the rate of the clock \n"});
