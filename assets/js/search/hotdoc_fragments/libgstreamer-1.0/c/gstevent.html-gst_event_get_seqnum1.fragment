Sequence numbers are typically used to indicate that a event corresponds to some other set of events or messages for example an EOS event corresponding to a SEEK event. It is considered good practice to make this correspondence when possible though it is not required. \nNote that events and messages share the same sequence number incrementor two events or messages will never have the same sequence number unless that correspondence was made explicitly. \n"});
