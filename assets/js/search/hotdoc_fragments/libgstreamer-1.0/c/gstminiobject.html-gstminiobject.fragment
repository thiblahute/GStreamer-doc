When the refcount of a mini object reaches the dispose function is called first and when this returns TRUE the free function of the miniobject is called. \nA copy can be made with gst_mini_object_copy. \ngst_mini_object_is_writable will return TRUE when the refcount of the object is exactly meaning the current caller has the only reference to the object. gst_mini_object_make_writable will return a writable version of the object which might be a new copy when the refcount was not \nOpaque data can be associated with a GstMiniObject with gst_mini_object_set_qdata and gst_mini_object_get_qdata. The data is meant to be specific to the particular object and is not automatically copied with gst_mini_object_copy or similar methods. \nA weak reference can be added and remove with gst_mini_object_weak_ref and gst_mini_object_weak_unref respectively. \n"});
