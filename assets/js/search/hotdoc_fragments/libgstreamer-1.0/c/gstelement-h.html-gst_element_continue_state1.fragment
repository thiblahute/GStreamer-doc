This function is used by elements that do asynchronous state changes. The core will normally call this method automatically when an element returned GST_STATE_CHANGE_SUCCESS from the state change function. \nIf after calling this method the element still has not reached the pending state the next state change is performed. \nThis method is used internally and should normally not be called by plugins or applications. \n"});
