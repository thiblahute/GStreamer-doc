It is currently a thin wrapper on top of GInitiallyUnowned. It is an abstract class that is not very usable on its own. \nGstObject gives us basic refcounting parenting functionality and locking. Most of the functions are just extended for special GStreamer needs and can be found under the same name in the base class of GstObject which is GObject e.g. g_object_ref becomes gst_object_ref \nSince GstObject derives from GInitiallyUnowned it also inherits the floating reference. Be aware that functions such as gst_bin_add and gst_element_add_pad take ownership of the floating reference. \nIn contrast to GObject instances GstObject adds a name property. The functions gst_object_set_name and gst_object_get_name are used to set get the name of the object. \n"});
