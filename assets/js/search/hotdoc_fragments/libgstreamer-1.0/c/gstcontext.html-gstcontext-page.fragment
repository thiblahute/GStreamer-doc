Elements can handle these in GstElement set_context and merge them with the context information they already have. \nWhen an element needs a context it will do the following actions in this order until one step succeeds \nBins will catch GST_MESSAGE_NEED_CONTEXT messages and will set any previously known context on the element that asks for it if possible. Otherwise the application should provide one if it can. \nGstContexts can be persistent. A persistent GstContext is kept in elements when they reach GST_STATE_NULL non persistent ones will be removed. Also a non persistent context won t override a previous persistent context set to an element. \n"});
