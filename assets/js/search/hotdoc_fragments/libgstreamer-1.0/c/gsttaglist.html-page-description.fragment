Unref the datetime with gst_date_time_unref when it is no longer needed. \nFree function gst_date_time_unref \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGets the sample that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list and copies it into the variable pointed to by sample. Free the sample with gst_sample_unref when it is no longer needed. You can retrieve the buffer from the sample using gst_sample_get_buffer and the associated caps if any with gst_sample_get_caps. \nFree function gst_sample_unref \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nThe resulting string in value will be in UTF encoding and should be freed by the caller using g_free when no longer needed. The returned string is also guaranteed to be non NULL and non empty. \nFree function g_free \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nPeeks at the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nThe resulting string in value will be in UTF encoding and doesn t need to be freed by the caller. The returned string is also guaranteed to be non NULL and non empty. \nThis is a convenience function for the func argument of gst_tag_register. It concatenates all given strings using a comma. The tag must be registered as a G_TYPE_STRING or this function will fail. \ngeo longitude location of where the media has been recorded or produced in degrees according to WGS84 zero at the prime meridian in Greenwich UK negative values for western longitudes double \ngeo elevation of where the media has been recorded or produced in meters according to WGS84 zero is average sea level double \nA location smaller than GST_TAG_GEO_LOCATION_CITY that specifies better where the media has been produced. e.g. the neighborhood string \nThis tag has been added as this is how it is handled named in XMP s Iptc4xmpcore schema. \nRepresents the expected error on the horizontal positioning in meters double \nSpeed of the capturing device when performing the capture.
