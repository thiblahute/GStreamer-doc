The array values need to hold enough space for n_values of the same type as the objects property s type. \nThis function is useful if one wants to e.g. draw a graph of the control curve or apply a control curve sample by sample. \nThe values are unboxed and ready to be used. The similar function gst_control_binding_get_g_value_array returns the array as GValue and is more suitable for bindings. \nCheck if the control binding is disabled. \nThis function is used to disable a control binding for some time i.e. gst_object_sync_values will do nothing. \nSets the property of the object according to the GstControlSource that handle them and for the given timestamp. \nIf this function fails it is most likely the application developers fault. Most probably the control sources are not setup correctly. \ngpointer _gst_reserved \n"});
