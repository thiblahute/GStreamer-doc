The function typically processes the data contained in the buffer and either consumes the data or passes it on to the internally linked pad s \nThe implementer of this function receives a refcount to buffer and should gst_buffer_unref when the buffer is no longer needed. \nWhen a chain function detects an error in the data stream it must post an error on the bus and return an appropriate GstFlowReturn value. \n"});
