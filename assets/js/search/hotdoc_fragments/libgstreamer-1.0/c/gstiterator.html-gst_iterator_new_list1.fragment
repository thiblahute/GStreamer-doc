The iterator implementation will notice the update of the cookie and will return GST_ITERATOR_RESYNC to the user of the iterator in the next call to gst_iterator_next. \nParameters \nGType of elements \npointer to a GMutex protecting the list. \npointer to a guint32 that is incremented when the list is changed. \npointer to the list \nobject owning the list \nfunction to call on each item retrieved \nthe new GstIterator for list. \nMT safe. \n"});
