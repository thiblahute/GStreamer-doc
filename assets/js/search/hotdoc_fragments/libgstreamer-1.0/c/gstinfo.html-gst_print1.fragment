fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/c/gstinfo.html#gst_print1", "fragment": "Outputs a formatted message via the GLib print handler. The default print handler simply outputs the message to stdout. \nThis function will not append a new line character at the end unlike gst_println which will. \nAll strings must be in ASCII or UTF encoding. \nThis function differs from g_print in that it supports all the additional printf specifiers that are supported by GStreamer s debug logging system such as GST_PTR_FORMAT and GST_SEGMENT_FORMAT. \nThis function is primarily for printing debug output. \n"});
