fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/c/gstpad.html#gst_pad_pull_range1", "fragment": "gst_pad_pull_range \nPulls a buffer from the peer pad or fills up a provided buffer. \nThis function will first trigger the pad block signal if it was installed. \nWhen pad is not linked GST_FLOW_NOT_LINKED is returned else this function returns the result of gst_pad_get_range on the peer pad. See gst_pad_get_range for a list of return values and for the semantics of the arguments of this function. \nIf buffer points to a variable holding NULL a valid new GstBuffer will be placed in buffer when this function returns GST_FLOW_OK. The new buffer must be freed with gst_buffer_unref after usage. When this function returns any other result value buffer will still point to NULL. \nWhen buffer points to a variable that points to a valid GstBuffer the buffer will be filled with the result data when this function returns GST_FLOW_OK. When this function returns any other result value buffer will be unchanged. If the provided buffer is larger than size only size bytes will be filled in the result buffer and its size will be updated accordingly. \nNote that less than size bytes can be returned in buffer when for example an EOS condition is near or when buffer is not large enough to hold size bytes. The caller should check the result buffer size to get the result size. \nParameters \na sink GstPad returns GST_FLOW_ERROR if not. \nThe start offset of the buffer \nThe length of the buffer \na pointer to hold the GstBuffer returns GST_FLOW_ERROR if NULL. \na GstFlowReturn from the peer pad. \nMT safe. \n"});
