See gst_bus_enable_sync_message_emission for more information. \nIn the event that multiple pieces of code have called gst_bus_enable_sync_message_emission the sync message emissions will only be stopped after all calls to gst_bus_enable_sync_message_emission were cancelled by calling this function. In this way the semantics are exactly the same as gst_object_ref that which calls enable should also call disable. \nMT safe. \nbus \na GstBus on which you previously called gst_bus_enable_sync_message_emission \n"});
