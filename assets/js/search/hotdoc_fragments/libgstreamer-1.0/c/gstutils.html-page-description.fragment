If temp is NULL an allocation will take place. temp should have at least the same amount of memory allocated as xy i.e. nsizeof GstClockTime \nThis function assumes x y values with reasonable large differences between them. It will not calculate the exact results if the differences between neighbouring values are too small due to not being able to represent sub integer values during the calculations. \nThis is a convenience wrapper around gst_parse_launch to create a GstBin from a gst launch style pipeline description. See gst_parse_launch and the gst launch man page for details about the syntax. Ghost pads on the bin for unlinked source or sink pads within the bin can automatically be created but only a maximum of one ghost pad for each direction will be created if you expect multiple unlinked source pads or multiple unlinked sink pads and want them all ghosted you will have to create the ghost pads yourself \nThis is a convenience wrapper around gst_parse_launch to create a GstBin from a gst launch style pipeline description.
