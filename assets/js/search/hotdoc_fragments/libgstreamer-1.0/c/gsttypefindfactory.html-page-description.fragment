You must free the list using gst_plugin_feature_list_free. \nThe returned factories are sorted by highest rank first and then by factory name. \nFree function gst_plugin_feature_list_free \nCalls the GstTypeFindFunction associated with this factory. \nGets the GstCaps associated with a typefind factory. \nGets the extensions associated with a GstTypeFindFactory. The returned array should not be changed. If you need to change stuff in it you should copy it using g_strdupv. This function may return NULL to indicate a length list. \nCheck whether the factory has a typefind function. Typefind factories without typefind functions are a last effort fallback mechanism to e.g. assume a certain media type based on the file extension. \n"});
