A plugin system can provide one or more of the basic GStreamer GstPluginFeature subclasses. \nA plugin should export a symbol gst_plugin_desc that is a struct of type GstPluginDesc. the plugin loader will check the version of the core library the plugin was linked against and will create a new GstPlugin. It will then call the GstPluginInitFunc function that was provided in the gst_plugin_desc. \nOnce you have a handle to a GstPlugin e.g. from the GstRegistry you can add any object that subclasses GstPluginFeature. \nUsually plugins are always automatically loaded so you don t need to call gst_plugin_load explicitly to bring it into memory. There are options to statically link plugins to an app or even use GStreamer without a plugin repository in which case gst_plugin_load can be needed to bring the plugin into memory. \n"});
