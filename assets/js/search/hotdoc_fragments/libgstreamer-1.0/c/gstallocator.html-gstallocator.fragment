When NULL is used as the allocator the default allocator will be used. \nNew allocators can be registered with gst_allocator_register. Allocators are identified by name and can be retrieved with gst_allocator_find. gst_allocator_set_default can be used to change the default allocator. \nNew memory can be created with gst_memory_new_wrapped that wraps the memory allocated elsewhere. \n"});
