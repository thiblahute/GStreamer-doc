fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/c/gstcaps.html#gst_caps_normalize1", "fragment": "gst_caps_normalize \nReturns a GstCaps that represents the same set of formats as caps but contains no lists. Each list is expanded into separate GstStructures. \nThis function takes ownership of caps and will call gst_caps_make_writable on it so you must not use caps afterwards unless you keep an additional reference to it with gst_caps_ref. \n"});
