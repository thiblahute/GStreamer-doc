Note that this method doesn t necessarily return the caps set by sending a gst_event_new_caps use gst_pad_get_current_caps for that instead. gst_pad_query_caps returns all possible caps a pad can operate with using the pad s CAPS query function If the query fails this function will return filter if not NULL otherwise ANY. \nWhen called on sinkpads filter contains the caps that upstream could produce in the order preferred by upstream. When called on srcpads filter contains the caps accepted by downstream in the preferred order. filter might be NULL but if it is not NULL the returned caps will be a subset of filter. \nNote that this function does not return writable GstCaps use gst_caps_make_writable before modifying the caps. \nParameters \na GstPad to get the capabilities of. \nsuggested GstCaps or NULL \nthe caps of the pad with incremented ref count. \n"});
