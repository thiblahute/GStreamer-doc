If state points to NULL the first metadata of type meta_api_type is returned. \nstate will be updated with an opaque state pointer \nRemove length memory blocks in buffer starting from idx. \nlength can be in which case all memory starting from idx is removed. \nReplaces all memory in buffer with mem. \nReplaces length memory blocks in buffer starting at idx with mem. \nIf length is all memory starting from idx will be removed and replaced with mem. \nbuffer should be writable. \nGet the global GstMetaInfo describing the GstParentBufferMeta meta. \nTests if the end offset is known. \nFind and return a GstParentBufferMeta if one exists on the buffer \n"});
