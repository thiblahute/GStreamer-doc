If clip_start or clip_stop are different from start or stop respectively the region fell partially in the segment. \nNote that when stop is clip_stop will be set to the end of the segment. Depending on the use case this may or may not be what you want. \nParameters \na GstSegment structure. \nthe format of the segment. \nthe start position in the segment \nthe stop position in the segment \nthe clipped start position in the segment \nthe clipped stop position in the segment \nTRUE if the given start and stop times fall partially or completely in segment FALSE if the values are completely outside of the segment. \n"});
