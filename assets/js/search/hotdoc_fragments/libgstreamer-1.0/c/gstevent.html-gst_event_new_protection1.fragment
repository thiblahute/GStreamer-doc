fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/c/gstevent.html#gst_event_new_protection1", "fragment": "Creates a new event containing information specific to a particular protection system uniquely identified by system_id by which that protection system can acquire key s to decrypt a protected stream. \nIn order for a decryption element to decrypt media protected using a specific system it first needs all the protection system specific information necessary to acquire the decryption key s for that stream. The functions defined here enable this information to be passed in events from elements that extract it e.g. ISOBMFF demuxers MPEG DASH demuxers to protection decrypter elements that use it. \nEvents containing protection system specific information are created using gst_event_new_protection and they can be parsed by downstream elements using gst_event_parse_protection. \nIn Common Encryption protection system specific information may be located within ISOBMFF files both in movie moov boxes and movie fragment moof boxes it may also be contained in ContentProtection elements within MPEG DASH MPDs. The events created by gst_event_new_protection contain data identifying from which of these locations the encapsulated protection system specific information originated. This origin information is required as some protection systems use different encodings depending upon where the information originates. \nThe events returned by gst_event_new_protection are implemented in such a way as to ensure that the most recently pushed protection info event of a particular origin and system_id will be stuck to the output pad of the sending element. \n"});
