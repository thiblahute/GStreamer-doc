Compared to gst_segment_to_stream_time this function can return negative stream time. \nThis function is typically used by elements that need to synchronize buffers against the clock or eachother. \nposition can be any value and the result of this function for values outside of the segment is extrapolated. \nWhen is returned position resulted in a positive stream time returned in stream_time. \nWhen this function returns the returned stream_time should be negated to get the real negative stream time. \n"});
