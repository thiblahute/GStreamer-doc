This list may not be modified. \nLike gst_uri_from_string but also joins with a base URI. \nGet the media fragment table from the URI as defined by Media Fragments URI Hash table returned by this API is a list of key value pairs and the each pair is generated by splitting URI fragment per sub delims then key and value are splitted by sub delims. The key returned by this API may be undefined keyword by standard. A value may be NULL to indicate that the key should appear in the fragment string in the URI but does not have a value. Free the returned GHashTable with g_hash_table_unref when it is no longer required. Modifying this hash table does not affect the fragment in the URI. \nSee more about Media Fragments URI W3C at https www.w3.org TR media frags \nChecks if an element exists that supports the given URI protocol.
