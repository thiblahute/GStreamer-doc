Caps structures with the same name but with a non equal set of caps features are not compatible. If a pad supports multiple sets of features it has to add multiple equal structures with different feature sets to the caps. \nEmpty GstCapsFeatures are equivalent with the GstCapsFeatures that only contain GST_CAPS_FEATURE_MEMORY_SYSTEM_MEMORY. ANY GstCapsFeatures as created by gst_caps_features_new_any are equal to any other GstCapsFeatures and can be used to specify that any GstCapsFeatures would be supported e.g. for elements that don t touch buffer memory. GstCaps with ANY GstCapsFeatures are considered non fixed and during negotiation some GstCapsFeatures have to be selected. \nExamples for caps features would be the requirement of a specific GstMemory types or the requirement of having a specific GstMeta on the buffer. Features are given as a string of the format memory GstMemoryTypeName or meta GstMetaAPIName \n"});
