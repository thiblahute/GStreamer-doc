The new requested position in the segment depends on rate and start_type and stop_type. \nFor positive rate the new position in the segment is the new segment start field when it was updated with a start_type different from GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE. If no update was performed on segment start position GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE start is ignored and segment position is unmodified. \nFor negative rate the new position in the segment is the new segment stop field when it was updated with a stop_type different from GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE. If no stop was previously configured in the segment the duration of the segment will be used to update the stop position. If no update was performed on segment stop position GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE stop is ignored and segment position is unmodified. \nThe applied rate of the segment will be set to by default. If the caller can apply a rate change it should update segment rate and applied_rate after calling this function. \nupdate will be set to TRUE if a seek should be performed to the segment position field. This field can be FALSE if for example only the rate has been changed but not the playback position. \n"});
