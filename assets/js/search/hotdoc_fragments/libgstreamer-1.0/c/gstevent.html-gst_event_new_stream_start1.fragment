The stream start event can only travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow. It is expected to be the first event that is sent for a new stream. \nSource elements demuxers and other elements that create new streams are supposed to send this event as the first event of a new stream. It should not be sent after a flushing seek or in similar situations and is used to mark the beginning of a new logical stream. Elements combining multiple streams must ensure that this event is only forwarded downstream once and not for every single input stream. \nThe stream_id should be a unique string that consists of the upstream stream id as separator and a unique stream id for this specific stream. A new stream id should only be created for a stream if the upstream stream is split into potentially multiple new streams e.g. in a demuxer but not for every single element in the pipeline. gst_pad_create_stream_id or gst_pad_create_stream_id_printf can be used to create a stream id. There are no particular semantics for the stream id though it should be deterministic to support stream matching and it might be used to order streams besides any information conveyed by stream flags \n"});
