Typically the task will run in a new thread. \nThe function cannot be changed after the task has been created. You must create a new GstTask to change the function. \nThis function will not yet create and start a thread. Use gst_task_start or gst_task_pause to create and start the GThread. \nBefore the task can be used a GRecMutex must be configured using the gst_task_set_lock function. This lock will always be acquired while func is called. \n"});
