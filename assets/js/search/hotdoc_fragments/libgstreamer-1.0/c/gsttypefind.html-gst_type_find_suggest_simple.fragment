A GstTypeFindFunction may supply different suggestions in one call. It is up to the caller of the GstTypeFindFunction to interpret these values. \nThis function is similar to gst_type_find_suggest only that instead of passing a GstCaps argument you can create the caps on the fly in the same way as you can with gst_caps_new_simple. \nMake sure you terminate the list of arguments with a NULL argument and that the values passed have the correct type in terms of width in bytes when passed to the vararg function this applies particularly to gdouble and guint64 arguments \nParameters \nThe GstTypeFind object the function was called with \nThe probability in percent that the suggestion is right \nthe media type of the suggested caps \nfirst field of the suggested caps or NULL \nadditional arguments to the suggested caps in the same format as the arguments passed to gst_structure_new ie. triplets of field name field GType and field value \n"});
