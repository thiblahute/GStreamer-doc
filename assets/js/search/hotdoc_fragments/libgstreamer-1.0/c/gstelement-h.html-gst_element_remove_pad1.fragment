Pads that were dynamically requested from elements with gst_element_request_pad should be released with the gst_element_release_request_pad function instead. \nPads are not automatically deactivated so elements should perform the needed steps to deactivate the pad in case this pad is removed in the PAUSED or PLAYING state. See gst_pad_set_active for more information about deactivating pads. \nThe pad and the element should be unlocked when calling this function. \nThis function will emit the GstElement pad removed signal on the element. \n"});
