All flags can be used together. \nA non flushing seek might take some time to perform as the currently playing data in the pipeline will not be cleared. \nAn accurate seek might be slower for formats that don t have any indexes or timestamp markers in the stream. Specifying this flag might require a complete scan of the file in those cases. \nWhen performing a segment seek after the playback of the segment completes no EOS will be emitted by the element that performed the seek but a GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_DONE message will be posted on the bus by the element. When this message is posted it is possible to send a new seek event to continue playback. With this seek method it is possible to perform seamless looping or simple linear editing. \nWhen doing fast forward rate or fast reverse rate trickmode playback the GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE flag can be used to instruct decoders and demuxers to adjust the playback rate by skipping frames. This can improve performance and decrease CPU usage because not all frames need to be decoded. \nBeyond that the GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_KEY_UNITS flag can be used to request that decoders skip all frames except key units and GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_NO_AUDIO flags can be used to request that audio decoders do no decoding at all and simple output silence. \nThe GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_BEFORE flag can be used to snap to the previous relevant location and the GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_AFTER flag can be used to select the next relevant location. If GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT is specified the relevant location is a keyframe. If both flags are specified the nearest of these locations will be selected. If none are specified the implementation is free to select whichever it wants. \nThe before and after here are in running time so when playing backwards the next location refers to the one that will played in next and not the one that is located after in the actual source stream. \nAlso see part seeking.txt in the GStreamer design documentation for more details on the meaning of these flags and the behaviour expected of elements that handle them. \nMembers \n"});
