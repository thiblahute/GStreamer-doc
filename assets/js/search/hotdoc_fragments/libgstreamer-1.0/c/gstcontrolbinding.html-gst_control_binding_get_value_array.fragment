The array values need to hold enough space for n_values of the same type as the objects property s type. \nThis function is useful if one wants to e.g. draw a graph of the control curve or apply a control curve sample by sample. \nThe values are unboxed and ready to be used. The similar function gst_control_binding_get_g_value_array returns the array as GValue and is more suitable for bindings. \nbinding \nthe control binding \ntimestamp \nthe time that should be processed \ninterval \nthe time spacing between subsequent values \nn_values \nthe number of values \nvalues \narray to put control values in \n\nTRUE if the given array could be filled FALSE otherwise \n"});
