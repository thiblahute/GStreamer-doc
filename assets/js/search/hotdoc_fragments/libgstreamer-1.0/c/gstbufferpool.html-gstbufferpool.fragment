A call to gst_buffer_pool_get_config returns the current configuration structure from the pool. With gst_buffer_pool_config_set_params and gst_buffer_pool_config_set_allocator the bufferpool parameters and allocator can be configured. Other properties can be configured in the pool depending on the pool implementation. \nA bufferpool can have extra options that can be enabled with gst_buffer_pool_config_add_option. The available options can be retrieved with gst_buffer_pool_get_options. Some options allow for additional configuration properties to be set. \nAfter the configuration structure has been configured gst_buffer_pool_set_config updates the configuration in the pool. This can fail when the configuration structure is not accepted. \nAfter the a pool has been configured it can be activated with gst_buffer_pool_set_active. This will preallocate the configured resources in the pool. \nWhen the pool is active gst_buffer_pool_acquire_buffer can be used to retrieve a buffer from the pool. \nBuffers allocated from a bufferpool will automatically be returned to the pool with gst_buffer_pool_release_buffer when their refcount drops to \nThe bufferpool can be deactivated again with gst_buffer_pool_set_active. All further gst_buffer_pool_acquire_buffer calls will return an error. When all buffers are returned to the pool they will be freed. \nUse gst_object_unref to release the reference to a bufferpool. If the refcount of the pool reaches the pool will be freed. \n"});
