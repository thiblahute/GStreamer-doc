The provided callback is called for every state that matches mask. \nProbes are called in groups First GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_BLOCK probes are called then others then finally GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_IDLE. The only exception here are GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_IDLE probes that are called immediately if the pad is already idle while calling gst_pad_add_probe. In each of the groups probes are called in the order in which they were added. \n"});
