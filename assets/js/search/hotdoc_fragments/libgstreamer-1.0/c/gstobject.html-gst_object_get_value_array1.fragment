fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/c/gstobject.html#gst_object_get_value_array1", "fragment": "Gets a number of values for the given controlled property starting at the requested time. The array values need to hold enough space for n_values of the same type as the objects property s type. \nThis function is useful if one wants to e.g. draw a graph of the control curve or apply a control curve sample by sample. \nThe values are unboxed and ready to be used. The similar function gst_object_get_g_value_array returns the array as GValue and is better suites for bindings. \n"});
