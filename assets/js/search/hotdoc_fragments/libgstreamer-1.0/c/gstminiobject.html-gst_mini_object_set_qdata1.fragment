The name is specified through a GQuark retrieved e.g. via g_quark_from_static_string and the pointer can be gotten back from the object with gst_mini_object_get_qdata until the object is disposed. Setting a previously set user data pointer overrides frees the old pointer set using NULL as pointer essentially removes the data stored. \ndestroy may be specified which is called with data as argument when the object is disposed or the data is being overwritten by a call to gst_mini_object_set_qdata with the same quark. \n"});
