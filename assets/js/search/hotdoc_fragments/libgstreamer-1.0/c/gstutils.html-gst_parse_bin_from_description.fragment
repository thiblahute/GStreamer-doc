See gst_parse_launch and the gst launch man page for details about the syntax. Ghost pads on the bin for unlinked source or sink pads within the bin can automatically be created but only a maximum of one ghost pad for each direction will be created if you expect multiple unlinked source pads or multiple unlinked sink pads and want them all ghosted you will have to create the ghost pads yourself \n"});
