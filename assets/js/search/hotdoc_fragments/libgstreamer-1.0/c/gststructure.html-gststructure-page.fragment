The keys are expressed as GQuarks and the values can be of any GType. \nIn addition to the key value pairs a GstStructure also has a name. The name starts with a letter and can be filled by letters numbers and any of _. \nGstStructure is used by various GStreamer subsystems to store information in a flexible and extensible way. A GstStructure does not have a refcount because it usually is part of a higher level object such as GstCaps GstMessage GstEvent GstQuery. It provides a means to enforce mutability using the refcount of the parent with the gst_structure_set_parent_refcount method. \nA GstStructure can be created with gst_structure_new_empty or gst_structure_new which both take a name and an optional set of key value pairs along with the types of the values. \nField values can be changed with gst_structure_set_value or gst_structure_set. \nField values can be retrieved with gst_structure_get_value or the more convenient gst_structure_get_ functions. \nFields can be removed with gst_structure_remove_field or gst_structure_remove_fields. \nStrings in structures must be ASCII or UTF encoded. Other encodings are not allowed. Strings may be NULL however. \nBe aware that the current GstCaps GstStructure serialization into string has limited support for nested GstCaps GstStructure fields. It can only support one level of nesting. Using more levels will lead to unexpected behavior when using serialization features such as gst_caps_to_string or gst_value_serialize and their counterparts. \n"});
