Side effect is that if one of the pads has no parent it becomes a child of the parent of the other element. If they have different parents the link fails. \nCalling gst_element_link_pads_full with flags GST_PAD_LINK_CHECK_DEFAULT is the same as calling gst_element_link_pads and the recommended way of linking pads with safety checks applied. \nThis is a convenience function for gst_pad_link_full. \n"});
