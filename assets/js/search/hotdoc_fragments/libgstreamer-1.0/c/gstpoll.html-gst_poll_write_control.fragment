This function is mostly useful for timer GstPoll objects created with gst_poll_new_timer. \nIt will make any current and future gst_poll_wait function return with meaning the control socket is set. After an equal amount of calls to gst_poll_read_control have been performed calls to gst_poll_wait will block again until their timeout expired. \nThis function only works for timer GstPoll objects created with gst_poll_new_timer. \nParameters \na GstPoll. \nTRUE on success. FALSE when when the byte could not be written. errno contains the detailed error code but will never be EAGAIN EINTR or EWOULDBLOCK. FALSE always signals a critical error. \n"});
