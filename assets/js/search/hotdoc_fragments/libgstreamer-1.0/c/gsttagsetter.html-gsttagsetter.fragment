Examples of such elements are vorbisenc theoraenc and id3v2mux \nIf you just want to retrieve metadata in your application then all you need to do is watch for tag messages on your pipeline s bus. This interface is only for setting metadata not for extracting it. To set tags from the application find tagsetter elements and set tags using e.g. gst_tag_setter_merge_tags or gst_tag_setter_add_tags. Also consider setting the GstTagMergeMode that is used for tag events that arrive at the tagsetter element default mode is to keep existing tags The application should do that before the element goes to GST_STATE_PAUSED. \nElements implementing the GstTagSetter interface often have to merge any tags received from upstream and the tags set by the application via the interface. This can be done like this \n\n"});
