They are composed of an array of GstStructure. \nCaps are exposed on GstPadTemplate to describe all possible types a given pad can handle. They are also stored in the GstRegistry along with a description of the GstElement. \nCaps are exposed on the element pads using the gst_pad_query_caps pad function. This function describes the possible types that the pad can handle or produce at runtime. \nA GstCaps can be constructed with the following code fragment \nA GstCaps is fixed when it has no properties with ranges or lists. Use gst_caps_is_fixed to test for fixed caps. Fixed caps can be used in a caps event to notify downstream elements of the current media type. \nVarious methods exist to work with the media types such as subtracting or intersecting. \nBe aware that the current GstCaps GstStructure serialization into string has limited support for nested GstCaps GstStructure fields. It can only support one level of nesting. Using more levels will lead to unexpected behavior when using serialization features such as gst_caps_to_string or gst_value_serialize and their counterparts. \n"});
