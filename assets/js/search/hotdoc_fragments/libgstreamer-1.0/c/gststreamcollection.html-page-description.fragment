Applications can use the collection to show the user what streams are available by using gst_stream_collection_get_stream \nOnce posted a GstStreamCollection is immutable. Updates are made by sending a new GstStreamCollection message which may or may not share some of the GstStream objects from the collection it replaces. The receiver can check the sender of a stream collection message to know which collection is obsoleted. \nSeveral elements in a pipeline can provide GstStreamCollection. \nApplications can activate streams from a collection by using the GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS event on a pipeline bin or element. \nGstStreamCollectionPrivate priv \nAdd the given stream to the collection. \nGet the number of streams this collection contains \nRetrieve the GstStream with index index from the collection. \nThe caller should not modify the returned GstStream \nReturns the upstream id of the collection. \nGstStreamCollection class structure \ngpointer _gst_reserved \n"});
