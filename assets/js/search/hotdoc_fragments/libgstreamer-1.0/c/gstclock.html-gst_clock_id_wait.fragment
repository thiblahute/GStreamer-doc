Positive values indicate how late id was relative to the clock in which case this function will return GST_CLOCK_EARLY Negative values indicate how much time was spent waiting on the clock before this function returned. \nParameters \nThe GstClockID to wait on \na pointer that will contain the jitter can be NULL. \nthe result of the blocking wait. GST_CLOCK_EARLY will be returned if the current clock time is past the time of id GST_CLOCK_OK if id was scheduled in time. GST_CLOCK_UNSCHEDULED if id was unscheduled with gst_clock_id_unschedule. \nMT safe. \n"});
