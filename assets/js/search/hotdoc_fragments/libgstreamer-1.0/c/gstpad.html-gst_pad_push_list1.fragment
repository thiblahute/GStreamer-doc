If pad has no peer GST_FLOW_NOT_LINKED will be returned. If the peer pad does not have any installed chainlist function every group buffer of the list will be merged into a normal GstBuffer and chained via gst_pad_chain. \nIn all cases success or failure the caller loses its reference to list after calling this function. \n"});
