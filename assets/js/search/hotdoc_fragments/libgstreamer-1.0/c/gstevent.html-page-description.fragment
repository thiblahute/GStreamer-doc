The stream collection event can only travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow. \nSource elements demuxers and other elements that manage collections of streams and post GstStreamCollection messages on the bus also send this event downstream on each pad involved in the collection so that activation of a new collection can be tracked through the downstream data flow. \nCreate a new Stream Group Done event. The stream group done event can only travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow. Elements that receive the event on a pad should handle it mostly like EOS and emit any data or pending buffers that would depend on more data arriving and unblock since there won t be any more data. \nThis event is followed by EOS at some point in the future and is generally used when switching pads to unblock downstream so that new pads can be exposed before sending EOS on the existing pads. \nRetrieve the accumulated running time offset of the event. \nEvents passing through GstPad that have a running time offset set via gst_pad_set_offset will get their offset adjusted according to the pad s offset. \nIf the event contains any information that related to the running time this information will need to be updated before usage with this offset. \nParse the SELECT_STREAMS event and retrieve the contained streams. \nRetrieve new GstStreamCollection from STREAM_COLLECTION event event. \nParse a stream group done event and store the result in the given group_id location. \nSet the running time offset of a event. See gst_event_get_running_time_offset for more information. \nMT safe. \nCustom out of band downstream event. \nGST_EVENT_CUSTOM_DOWNSTREAM_STICKY \nCustom sticky downstream event. \nGST_EVENT_CUSTOM_BOTH \n"});
