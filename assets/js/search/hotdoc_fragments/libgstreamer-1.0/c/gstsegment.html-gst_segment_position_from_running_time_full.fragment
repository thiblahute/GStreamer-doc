Compared to gst_segment_position_from_running_time this function can return negative segment position. \nThis function is typically used by elements that need to synchronize buffers against the clock or each other. \nrunning_time can be any value and the result of this function for values outside of the segment is extrapolated. \nWhen is returned running_time resulted in a positive position returned in position. \nWhen this function returns the returned position should be negated to get the real negative segment position. \n"});
