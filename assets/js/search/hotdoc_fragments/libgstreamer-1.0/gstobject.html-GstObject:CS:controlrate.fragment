Audio processing Gst.Element objects will use this rate to sub divide their processing loop and call Gst.Object.SyncValues inbetween. The length of the processing segment should be up to control rate nanoseconds. \nIf the object is not under property control this will return Gst.Constants.CLOCK_TIME_NONE. This allows the element to avoid the sub dividing. \nThe control rate is not expected to change if the element is in Gst.State.Paused or Gst.State.Playing. \nFlags Read Write \n"});
