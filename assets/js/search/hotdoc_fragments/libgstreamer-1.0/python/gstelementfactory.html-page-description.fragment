Only elements with a rank greater or equal to minrank will be returned. The list of factories is returned by decreasing rank. \nChecks if the factory can sink all possible capabilities. \nChecks if the factory can sink any possible capability. \nChecks if the factory can src all possible capabilities. \nChecks if the factory can src any possible capability. \nGet the GObject.Type for elements managed by this factory. The type can only be retrieved if the element factory is loaded which can be assured with Gst.PluginFeature.load. \nGet the available keys for the metadata on factory. \nGets the number of pad_templates in this factory. \nGets the GLib.List of Gst.StaticPadTemplate for this factory. \nGets a None terminated array of protocols this element supports or None if no protocols are supported. You may not change the contents of the returned array as it is still owned by the element factory. Use g_strdupv not introspectable to make a copy of the protocol string array if you need to. \nCheck if factory implements the interface with name interfacename. \nElements matching any of the defined GST_ELEMENT_FACTORY_TYPE_MEDIA types \nNote Do not use this if you wish to not filter against any of the defined media types. If you wish to do this simply don t specify any GST_ELEMENT_FACTORY_TYPE_MEDIA flag. \nAll encoders handling video or image media types \nAll encoders handling audio media types \nAll sinks handling audio video or image media types \nAll elements used to decode streams decoders demuxers parsers depayloaders \n"});
