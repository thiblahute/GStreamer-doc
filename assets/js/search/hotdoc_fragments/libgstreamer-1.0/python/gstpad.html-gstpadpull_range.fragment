fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/python/gstpad.html#gstpadpull_range", "fragment": "Pulls a buffer from the peer pad or fills up a provided buffer. \nThis function will first trigger the pad block signal if it was installed. \nWhen pad is not linked Gst.FlowReturn.not_linked is returned else this function returns the result of Gst.Pad.get_range on the peer pad. See Gst.Pad.get_range for a list of return values and for the semantics of the arguments of this function. \nIf buffer points to a variable holding None a valid new Gst.Buffer will be placed in buffer when this function returns Gst.FlowReturn.ok. The new buffer must be freed with gst_buffer_unref not introspectable after usage. When this function returns any other result value buffer will still point to None. \nWhen buffer points to a variable that points to a valid Gst.Buffer the buffer will be filled with the result data when this function returns Gst.FlowReturn.ok. When this function returns any other result value buffer will be unchanged. If the provided buffer is larger than size only size bytes will be filled in the result buffer and its size will be updated accordingly. \nNote that less than size bytes can be returned in buffer when for example an EOS condition is near or when buffer is not large enough to hold size bytes. The caller should check the result buffer size to get the result size. \n"});
