If the element completes the state change or goes into an error this function returns immediately with a return value of Gst.StateChangeReturn.success or Gst.StateChangeReturn.failure respectively. \nFor elements that did not return Gst.StateChangeReturn.async this function returns the current and pending state immediately. \nThis function returns Gst.StateChangeReturn.no_preroll if the element successfully changed its state but is not able to provide data yet. This mostly happens for live sources that only produce data in Gst.State.playing. While the state change return is equivalent to Gst.StateChangeReturn.success it is returned to the application to signal that some sink elements might not be able to complete their state change because an element is not producing data to complete the preroll. When setting the element to playing the preroll will complete and playback will start. \nParameters \na Gst.Element to get the state of. \na Gst.ClockTime to specify the timeout for an async state change or Gst.CLOCK_TIME_NONE for infinite timeout. \nReturns a tuple made of \nGst.StateChangeReturn.success if the element has no more pending state and the last state change succeeded Gst.StateChangeReturn.async if the element is still performing a state change or Gst.StateChangeReturn.failure if the last state change failed. \nMT safe. \nGst.StateChangeReturn.success if the element has no more pending state and the last state change succeeded Gst.StateChangeReturn.async if the element is still performing a state change or Gst.StateChangeReturn.failure if the last state change failed. \nMT safe. \nGst.StateChangeReturn.success if the element has no more pending state and the last state change succeeded Gst.StateChangeReturn.async if the element is still performing a state change or Gst.StateChangeReturn.failure if the last state change failed. \nMT safe. \n"});
