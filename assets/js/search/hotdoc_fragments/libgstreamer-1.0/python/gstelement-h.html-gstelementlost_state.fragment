The current state of the element is copied to the pending state so that any call to Gst.Element.get_state will return Gst.StateChangeReturn.async. \nAn ASYNC_START message is posted. If the element was PLAYING it will go to PAUSED. The element will be restored to its PLAYING state by the parent pipeline when it prerolls again. \nThis is mostly used for elements that lost their preroll buffer in the Gst.State.paused or Gst.State.playing state after a flush they will go to their pending state again when a new preroll buffer is queued. This function can only be called when the element is currently not in error or an async state change. \nThis function is used internally and should normally not be called from plugins or applications. \n"});
