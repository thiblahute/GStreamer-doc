The eos event can only travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow. Elements that receive the EOS event on a pad can return Gst.FlowReturn.eos as a Gst.FlowReturn when data after the EOS event arrives. \nThe EOS event will travel down to the sink elements in the pipeline which will then post the Gst.MessageType.eos on the bus after they have finished playing any buffered data. \nWhen all sinks have posted an EOS message an EOS message is forwarded to the application. \nThe EOS event itself will not cause any state transitions of the pipeline. \n\nthe new EOS event. \n"});
