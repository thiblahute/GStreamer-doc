If a type with that name is already registered that one is used. The old registration may have used a different type however. So don t rely on your supplied values. \nImportant if you do not supply a merge function the implication will be that there can only be one single value for this tag in a tag list and any additional values will silently be discarded when being added unless Gst.TagMergeMode.replace Gst.TagMergeMode.replace_all or Gst.TagMergeMode.prepend is used as merge mode in which case the new value will replace the old one in the list \nThe merge function will be called from Gst.tag_list_copy_value when it is required that one or more values for a tag be condensed into one single value. This may happen from Gst.TagList.get_string Gst.TagList.get_int Gst.TagList.get_double etc. What will happen exactly in that case depends on how the tag was registered and if a merge function was supplied and if so which one. \nTwo default merge functions are provided Gst.tag_merge_use_first and Gst.tag_merge_strings_with_comma. \nname \nthe name or identifier string \nflag \na flag describing the type of tag info \ntype \nthe type this data is in \nnick \nhuman readable name \nblurb \na human readable description about this tag \nfunc \nfunction for merging multiple values of this tag or None \n"});
