This is useful for plugins which wrap other plugin systems e.g. a plugin which wraps a plugin based visualisation library and makes visualisations available as GStreamer elements or a codec loader which exposes elements and or caps dependent on what external codec libraries are currently installed. \nConvenience wrapper function for Gst.Plugin.add_dependency which takes simple strings as arguments instead of string arrays with multiple arguments separated by predefined delimiters see above \nGet the release date and possibly time in form of a string if available. \nFor normal GStreamer plugin releases this will usually just be a date in the form of YYYY MM DD while pre releases and builds from git may contain a time component after the date as well in which case the string will be formatted like YYYY MM DDTHH MMZ e.g. T09 Z \nThere may be plugins that do not have a valid release date set on them. \ngpointer _gst_reserved \nno special flags \nGst.PluginDependencyFlags.recurse \nrecurse into subdirectories \nGst.PluginDependencyFlags.paths_are_default_only \nuse paths argument only if none of the environment variables is set \nGst.PluginDependencyFlags.file_name_is_suffix \ninterpret filename argument as filter suffix and check all matching files in the directory \nGst.PluginDependencyFlags.file_name_is_prefix \ninterpret filename argument as filter prefix and check all matching files in the directory.
