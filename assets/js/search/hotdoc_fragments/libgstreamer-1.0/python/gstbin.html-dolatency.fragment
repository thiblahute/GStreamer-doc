This signal is only emitted for toplevel bins or when async handling is enabled. \nOnly one signal handler is invoked. If no signals are connected the default handler is invoked which will query and distribute the lowest possible latency to all sinks. \nConnect to this signal if the default latency calculations are not sufficient like when you need different latencies for different sinks in the same pipeline. \nParameters \nFlags Run Last \n"});
