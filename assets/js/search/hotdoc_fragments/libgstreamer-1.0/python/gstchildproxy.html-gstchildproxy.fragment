Imagine elements such as mixers or polyphonic generators. They all have multiple Gst.Pad or some kind of voice objects. Another use case are container elements like Gst.Bin. The element implementing the interface acts as a parent for those child objects. \nBy implementing this interface the child properties can be accessed from the parent element by using gst_child_proxy_get not introspectable and gst_child_proxy_set not introspectable \nProperty names are written as child name property name The whole naming scheme is recursive. Thus child1 child2 property is valid too if child1 and child2 implement the Gst.ChildProxy interface. \n"});
