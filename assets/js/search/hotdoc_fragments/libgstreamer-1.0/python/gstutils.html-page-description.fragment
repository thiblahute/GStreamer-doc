fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/python/gstutils.html#page-description", "fragment": "Calculates the linear regression of the values xy and places the result in m_num m_denom b and xbase representing the function y x m_num m_denom x xbase b that has the least square distance from all points x and y. \nr_squared will contain the remaining error. \nIf temp is not None it will be used as temporary space for the function in which case the function works without any allocation at all. If temp is None an allocation will take place. temp should have at least the same amount of memory allocated as xy i.e. nsizeof GstClockTime \nThis function assumes x y values with reasonable large differences between them. It will not calculate the exact results if the differences between neighbouring values are too small due to not being able to represent sub integer values during the calculations. \nThis is a convenience wrapper around Gst.parse_launch to create a Gst.Bin from a gst launch style pipeline description. See Gst.parse_launch and the gst launch man page for details about the syntax. Ghost pads on the bin for unlinked source or sink pads within the bin can automatically be created but only a maximum of one ghost pad for each direction will be created if you expect multiple unlinked source pads or multiple unlinked sink pads and want them all ghosted you will have to create the ghost pads yourself \nCalculates the greatest common divisor of a and b. \nCalculates the greatest common divisor of a and b. \nScale val by the rational number num denom avoiding overflows and underflows and without loss of precision. num must be non negative and denom must be positive. \n"});
