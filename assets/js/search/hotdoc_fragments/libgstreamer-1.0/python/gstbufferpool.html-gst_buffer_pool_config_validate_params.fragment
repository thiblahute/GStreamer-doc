This function is a helper that can be used to validate changes made by a pool to a config when Gst.BufferPool.set_config returns False. This expects that caps haven t changed and that min_buffers aren t lower then what we initially expected. This does not check if options or allocator parameters are still valid won t check if size have changed since changing the size is valid to adapt padding. \nconfig \na Gst.BufferPool configuration \ncaps \nthe excepted caps of buffers \nsize \nthe expected size of each buffer not including prefix and padding \nmin_buffers \nthe expected minimum amount of buffers to allocate. \nmax_buffers \nthe expect maximum amount of buffers to allocate or for unlimited. \n\nTrue if the parameters are valid in this context. \nSince \n"});
