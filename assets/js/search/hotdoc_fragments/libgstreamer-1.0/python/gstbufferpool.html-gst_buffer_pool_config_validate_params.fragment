This function is a helper that can be used to validate changes made by a pool to a config when Gst.BufferPool.set_config returns False. This expects that caps haven t changed and that min_buffers aren t lower then what we initially expected. This does not check if options or allocator parameters are still valid won t check if size have changed since changing the size is valid to adapt padding. \n"});
