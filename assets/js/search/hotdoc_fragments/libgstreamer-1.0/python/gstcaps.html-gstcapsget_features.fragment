However if you know the caps are writable either because you have just copied them or made them writable with gst_caps_make_writable not introspectable you may modify the features returned in the usual way e.g. with functions like Gst.CapsFeatures.add. \nYou do not need to free or unref the structure returned it belongs to the Gst.Caps. \n"});
