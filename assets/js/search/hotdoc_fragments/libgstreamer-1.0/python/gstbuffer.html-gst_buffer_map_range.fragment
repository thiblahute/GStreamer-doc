When length is all memory blocks starting from idx are merged and mapped. \nflags describe the desired access of the memory. When flags is Gst.MapFlags.write buffer should be writable as returned from gst_buffer_is_writable not introspectable \nWhen buffer is writable but the memory isn t a writable copy will automatically be created and returned. The readonly copy of the buffer memory will then also be replaced with this writable copy. \nThe memory in info should be unmapped with Gst.Buffer.unmap after usage. \nParameters \na Gst.Buffer. \nan index \na length \nflags for the mapping \nReturns a tuple made of \nTrue if the map succeeded and info contains valid data. \nTrue if the map succeeded and info contains valid data. \n"});
