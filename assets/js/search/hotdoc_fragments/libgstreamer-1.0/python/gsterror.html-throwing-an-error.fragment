The ones currently provided should be enough. If you find your type of error does not fit the current codes you should use FAILED. \nDon t provide a message if the default one suffices. this keeps messages more uniform. Use NULL not forgetting the parentheses. \nIf you do supply a custom message it should be marked for translation. The message should start with a capital and end with a period. The message should describe the error in short in a human readable form and without any complex technical terms. A user interface will present this message as the first thing a user sees. Details technical info should go in the debug string. \nThe debug string can be as you like. Again use NULL if there s nothing to add file and line number will still be passed. Gst.ERROR_SYSTEM can be used as a shortcut to give debug information on a system call error. \n"});
