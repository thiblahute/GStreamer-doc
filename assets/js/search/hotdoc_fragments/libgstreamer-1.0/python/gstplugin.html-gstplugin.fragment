A plugin system can provide one or more of the basic GStreamer Gst.PluginFeature subclasses. \nA plugin should export a symbol gst_plugin_desc that is a struct of type Gst.PluginDesc. the plugin loader will check the version of the core library the plugin was linked against and will create a new Gst.Plugin. It will then call the Gst.PluginInitFunc function that was provided in the gst_plugin_desc. \nOnce you have a handle to a Gst.Plugin e.g. from the Gst.Registry you can add any object that subclasses Gst.PluginFeature. \nUsually plugins are always automatically loaded so you don t need to call Gst.Plugin.load explicitly to bring it into memory. There are options to statically link plugins to an app or even use GStreamer without a plugin repository in which case Gst.Plugin.load can be needed to bring the plugin into memory. \n"});
