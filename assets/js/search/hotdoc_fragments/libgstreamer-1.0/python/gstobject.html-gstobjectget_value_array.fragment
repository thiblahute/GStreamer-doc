The array values need to hold enough space for n_values of the same type as the objects property s type. \nThis function is useful if one wants to e.g. draw a graph of the control curve or apply a control curve sample by sample. \nThe values are unboxed and ready to be used. The similar function Gst.Object.get_g_value_array returns the array as GObject.Value and is better suites for bindings. \nobject \nthe object that has controlled properties \nproperty_name \nthe name of the property to get \ntimestamp \nthe time that should be processed \ninterval \nthe time spacing between subsequent values \nn_values \nthe number of values \nvalues \narray to put control values in \n\nTrue if the given array could be filled False otherwise \n"});
