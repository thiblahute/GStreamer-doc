The array values need to hold enough space for n_values of the same type as the objects property s type. \nThis function is useful if one wants to e.g. draw a graph of the control curve or apply a control curve sample by sample. \nThe values are unboxed and ready to be used. The similar function Gst.Object.get_g_value_array returns the array as GValues and is better suites for bindings. \n"});
