The idea here is to create hierarchical element graphs. The bin element contains a sub graph. Now one would like to treat the bin element like any other Gst.Element. This is where GhostPads come into play. A GhostPad acts as a proxy for another pad. Thus the bin can have sink and source ghost pads that are associated with sink and source pads of the child elements. \nIf the target pad is known at creation time Gst.GhostPad.new is the function to use to get a ghost pad. Otherwise one can use Gst.GhostPad.new_no_target to create the ghost pad and use Gst.GhostPad.set_target to establish the association later on. \nNote that GhostPads add overhead to the data processing of a pipeline. \n"});
