The stream group done event can only travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow. Elements that receive the event on a pad should handle it mostly like EOS and emit any data or pending buffers that would depend on more data arriving and unblock since there won t be any more data. \nThis event is followed by EOS at some point in the future and is generally used when switching pads to unblock downstream so that new pads can be exposed before sending EOS on the existing pads. \n"});
