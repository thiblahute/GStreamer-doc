Pads from compatible templates can be linked together. \nGets the context with context_type set on the element or NULL. \nPost an error warning or info message on the bus from inside an element. \ntype must be of Gst.MessageType.error Gst.MessageType.warning or Gst.MessageType.info. \nTries to change the state of the element to the same as its parent.

This is mainly used in the _class_init functions of classes. If a pad template with the same name as an already existing one is added the old one is replaced by the new one. \nSet key with value as metadata in klass. \nSame as Gst.ElementClass.add_metadata but value must be a static string or an inlined string as it will not be copied. GStreamer plugins will be made resident once loaded so this function can be used even from dynamically loaded plugins. \nAdds a pad template to an element class based on the static pad template templ. This is mainly used in the _class_init functions of element implementations. If a pad template with the same name already exists the old one is replaced by the new one. \nRetrieves a padtemplate from element_class with the given name. \nIf you use this function in the GObject.InstanceInitFunc of an object class that has subclasses make sure to pass the g_class parameter of the GObject.InstanceInitFunc here. \nRetrieves a list of the pad templates associated with element_class. The list must not be modified by the calling code. \nIf you use this function in the GObject.InstanceInitFunc of an object class that has subclasses make sure to pass the g_class parameter of the GObject.InstanceInitFunc here. \nSets the detailed information for a Gst.ElementClass. \nThis function is for use in _class_init functions only. \nSame as Gst.ElementClass.set_metadata but longname classification description and author must be static strings or inlined strings as they will not be copied.
