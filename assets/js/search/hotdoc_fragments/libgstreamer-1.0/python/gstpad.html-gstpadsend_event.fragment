fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/python/gstpad.html#gstpadsend_event", "fragment": "Gst.Pad.send_event \nSends the event to the pad. This function can be used by applications to send events in the pipeline. \nIf pad is a source pad event should be an upstream event. If pad is a sink pad event should be a downstream event. For example you would not send a Gst.EventType.eos on a src pad EOS events only propagate downstream. Furthermore some downstream events have to be serialized with data flow like EOS while some can travel out of band like Gst.EventType.flush_start. If the event needs to be serialized with data flow this function will take the pad s stream lock while calling its event function. \nTo find out whether an event type is upstream downstream or downstream and serialized see Gst.EventTypeFlags Gst.event_type_get_flags Gst.EVENT_IS_UPSTREAM Gst.EVENT_IS_DOWNSTREAM and Gst.EVENT_IS_SERIALIZED. Note that in practice that an application or plugin doesn t need to bother itself with this information the core handles all necessary locks and checks. \nThis function takes ownership of the provided event so you should gst_event_ref not introspectable it if you want to reuse the event after this call. \n"});
