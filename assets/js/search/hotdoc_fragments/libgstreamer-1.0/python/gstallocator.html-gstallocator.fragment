When None is used as the allocator the default allocator will be used. \nNew allocators can be registered with Gst.Allocator.register. Allocators are identified by name and can be retrieved with Gst.Allocator.find. Gst.Allocator.set_default can be used to change the default allocator. \nNew memory can be created with Gst.Memory.new_wrapped that wraps the memory allocated elsewhere. \n"});
