fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/python/gstpipeline.html#gstpipelineset_auto_flush_bus", "fragment": "Usually when a pipeline goes from READY to NULL state it automatically flushes all pending messages on the bus which is done for refcounting purposes to break circular references. \nThis means that applications that update state using async bus messages e.g. do certain things when a pipeline goes from PAUSED to READY might not get to see messages when the pipeline is shut down because they might be flushed before they can be dispatched in the main thread. This behaviour can be disabled using this function. \nIt is important that all messages on the bus are handled when the automatic flushing is disabled else memory leaks will be introduced. \nMT safe. \n"});
