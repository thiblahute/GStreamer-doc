The position value must be between segment start and stop value. \nThis function is typically used by elements that need to operate on the stream time of the buffers it receives such as effect plugins. In those use cases position is typically the buffer timestamp or clock time that one wants to convert to the stream time. The stream time is always between and the total duration of the media stream. \n"});
