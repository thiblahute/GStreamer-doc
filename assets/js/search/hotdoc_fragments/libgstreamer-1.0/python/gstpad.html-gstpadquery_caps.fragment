Note that this method doesn t necessarily return the caps set by sending a Gst.Event.new_caps use Gst.Pad.get_current_caps for that instead. gst_pad_query_caps returns all possible caps a pad can operate with using the pad s CAPS query function If the query fails this function will return filter if not None otherwise ANY. \nWhen called on sinkpads filter contains the caps that upstream could produce in the order preferred by upstream. When called on srcpads filter contains the caps accepted by downstream in the preferred order. filter might be None but if it is not None the returned caps will be a subset of filter. \nNote that this function does not return writable Gst.Caps use gst_caps_make_writable not introspectable before modifying the caps. \n"});
