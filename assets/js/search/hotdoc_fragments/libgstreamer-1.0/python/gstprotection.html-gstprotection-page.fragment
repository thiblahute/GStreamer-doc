The demuxer would parse the protection information for a video audio frame from its input data and use this information to populate the Gst.Structure info field which is then encapsulated in a GstProtectionMeta object and attached to the corresponding output buffer using the Gst.Buffer.add_protection_meta function. The information in this attached GstProtectionMeta would be used by a downstream decrypter element to recover the original unencrypted frame. \n"});
