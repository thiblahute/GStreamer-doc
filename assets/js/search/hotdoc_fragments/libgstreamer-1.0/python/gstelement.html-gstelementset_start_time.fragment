The start time of the element is the running time of the element when it last went to the PAUSED state. In READY or after a flushing seek it is set to \nToplevel elements like Gst.Pipeline will manage the start_time and base_time on its children. Setting the start_time to Gst.CLOCK_TIME_NONE on such a toplevel element will disable the distribution of the base_time to the children and can be useful if the application manages the base_time itself for example if you want to synchronize capture from multiple pipelines and you can also ensure that the pipelines have the same clock. \nMT safe. \n"});
