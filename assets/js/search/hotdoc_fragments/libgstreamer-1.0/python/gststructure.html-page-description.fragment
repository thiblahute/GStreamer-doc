In contrast to Gst.Structure.foreach the function may modify the fields. In contrast to Gst.Structure.map_in_place the field is removed from the structure if False is returned from the function. The structure must be mutable. \nFixates a Gst.Structure by changing the given field_name field to the given target boolean if that field is not fixed yet. \nFixates a Gst.Structure by changing the given field to the nearest double to target that is a subset of the existing field. \nFixates a Gst.Structure by changing the given field to the nearest fraction to target_numerator target_denominator that is a subset of the existing field. \nFixates a Gst.Structure by changing the given field to the nearest integer to target that is a subset of the existing field. \nFixates a Gst.Structure by changing the given field_name field to the given target string if that field is not fixed yet. \nCheck if structure contains a field named field and with GType type. \nSets the parent_refcount field of Gst.Structure. This field is used to determine whether a structure is mutable or not. This function should only be called by code implementing parent objects of Gst.Structure as described in the MT Refcounting section of the design documents. \n"});
