It will however keep reporting its time adjusted with the last configured rate and time offsets. \nclock \na Gst.Clock \nmaster \na master Gst.Clock \n\nTrue if the clock is capable of being slaved to a master clock. Trying to set a master on a clock without the Gst.ClockFlags.can_set_master flag will make this function return False. \nMT safe. \n"});
