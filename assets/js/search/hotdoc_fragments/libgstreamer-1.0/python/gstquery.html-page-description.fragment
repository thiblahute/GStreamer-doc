The first memory allocator in the query should be generic and allow mapping to system memory all following allocators should be ordered by preference with the preferred one first. \nRetrieve the number of values currently stored in the pool array of the query s structure. \nRetrieve the number of values currently stored in the buffered ranges array of the query s structure. \nRetrieve the number of values currently stored in the scheduling mode array of the query s structure. \nCheck if query has scheduling mode set and flags is set in query scheduling flags. \nParse the result from query and store in result. \nGet the percentage of buffered data.

If a redirection is permanent applications should update their internal storage of the URI otherwise they should make all future requests to the original URI. \nRemove the metadata API at index of the metadata API array. \nRemove the allocation param at index of the allocation param array. \nRemove the allocation pool at index of the allocation pool array. \nSet result as the result for the query. \nParse an available query and get the allocator and its params at index of the allocator array. \nSet the pool parameters in query. \nAnswer a URI query by setting the requested URI redirection to permanent or not. \nif sequential access is recommended \nGst.SchedulingFlags.bandwidth_limited \nif bandwidth is limited and buffering possible since \n"});
