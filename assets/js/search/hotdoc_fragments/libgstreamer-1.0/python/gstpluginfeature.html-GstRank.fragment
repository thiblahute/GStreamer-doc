Defines the order in which the autoplugger or similar rank picking mechanisms such as e.g. Gst.Element.make_from_uri will choose this element over an alternative one with the same function. \nThese constants serve as a rough guidance for defining the rank of a Gst.PluginFeature. Any value is valid including values bigger than GST_RANK_PRIMARY. \n"});
