This message is posted by elements that know the duration of a stream when the duration changes. This message is received by bins and is used to calculate the total duration of a pipeline. \nCreate a new error message. The message will copy error and debug. This message is posted by element when a fatal event occurred. The pipeline will probably partially stop. The application receiving this message should stop the pipeline. \nCreate a new info message. The message will make copies of error and debug. \nCreates a new stream collection message. The message is used to announce new Gst.StreamCollection \nCreates a new steams selected message. The message is used to announce that an array of streams has been selected. This is generally in response to a Gst.EventType.select_streams event or when an element such as decodebin3 makes an initial selection of streams. \nThe message also contains the Gst.StreamCollection to which the various streams belong to. \nUsers of Gst.Message.new_streams_selected can add the selected streams with Gst.Message.streams_selected_add. \nCreate a new structure change message. This message is posted when the structure of a pipeline is in the process of being changed for example when pads are linked or unlinked. \nsrc should be the sinkpad that unlinked or linked. \nCreate a new warning message. The message will make copies of error and debug. \nExtracts the object managing the streaming thread from message. \nExtracts the buffering stats values from message. \nParses a device removed message. The device removed message is produced by Gst.DeviceProvider or a Gst.DeviceMonitor. It announces the disappearance of monitored devices. \nParses a property notify message. These will be posted on the bus only when set up with Gst.Element.add_property_notify_watch or Gst.Element.add_property_deep_notify_watch. \nParses the location and or structure from the entry with the given index. The index must be between and Gst.Message.get_num_redirect_entries Returned pointers are valid for as long as this message exists. \nParses a stream collection message. \nParses a streams selected message. \nExtracts the change type and completion status from the GstMessage. \nMT safe. \nReturns the optional details structure may be NULL if none The returned structure must not be freed. \nConfigures the object handling the streaming thread. This is usually a GstTask object but other objects might be added in the future. \nAdds the stream to the message. \nReturns the number of streams contained in the message. \nRetrieves the Gst.Stream with index index from the message. \na thread is destroyed \nGst.StreamStatusType.start \nPad linking is starting or done. \nGst.StructureChangeType.unlink \nPad unlinking is starting or done. \n"});
