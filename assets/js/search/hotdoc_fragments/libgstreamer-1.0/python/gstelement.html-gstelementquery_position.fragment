This will be a value between and the stream duration if the stream duration is known This query will usually only work once the pipeline is prerolled i.e. reached PAUSED or PLAYING state The application will receive an ASYNC_DONE message on the pipeline bus when that is the case. \nIf one repeatedly calls this function one can also create a query and reuse it in Gst.Element.query. \n"});
