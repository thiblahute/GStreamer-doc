fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/python/gstcaps.html#gstcaps_make_writable", "fragment": "Gst.caps_make_writable \nReturns a writable copy of caps. \nIf there is only one reference count on caps the caller must be the owner and so this function will return the caps object unchanged. If on the other hand there is more than one reference on the object a new caps object will be returned. The caller s reference on caps will be removed and instead the caller will own a reference to the returned object. \nIn short this function unrefs the caps in the argument and refs the caps that it returns. Don t access the argument after calling this function. See also gst_caps_ref not introspectable \n"});
