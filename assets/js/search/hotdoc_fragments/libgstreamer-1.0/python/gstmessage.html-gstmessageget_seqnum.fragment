Sequence numbers are typically used to indicate that a message corresponds to some other set of messages or events for example a SEGMENT_DONE message corresponding to a SEEK event. It is considered good practice to make this correspondence when possible though it is not required. \nNote that events and messages share the same sequence number incrementor two events or messages will never have the same sequence number unless that correspondence was made explicitly. \n"});
