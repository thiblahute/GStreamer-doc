To send an event application will usually use Gst.Element.send_event and elements will use Gst.Pad.send_event or Gst.Pad.push_event. The event should be unreffed with gst_event_unref if it has not been sent. \nEvents that have been received can be parsed with their respective gst_event_parse_ functions. It is valid to pass NULL for unwanted details. \nEvents are passed between elements in parallel to the data stream. Some events are serialized with buffers others are not. Some events only travel downstream others only upstream. Some events can travel both upstream and downstream. \nThe events are used to signal special conditions in the datastream such as EOS end of stream or the start of a new stream segment. Events are also used to flush the pipeline of any pending data. \nMost of the event API is used inside plugins. Applications usually only construct and use seek events. To do that Gst.Event.new_seek is used to create a seek event. It takes the needed parameters to specify seeking time and mode. \n"});
