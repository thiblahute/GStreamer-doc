They are composed of an array of Gst.Structure. \nCaps are exposed on Gst.PadTemplate to describe all possible types a given pad can handle. They are also stored in the Gst.Registry along with a description of the Gst.Element. \nCaps are exposed on the element pads using the Gst.Pad.prototype.query_caps pad function. This function describes the possible types that the pad can handle or produce at runtime. \nA Gst.Caps can be constructed with the following code fragment \nA Gst.Caps is fixed when it has no properties with ranges or lists. Use Gst.Caps.prototype.is_fixed to test for fixed caps. Fixed caps can be used in a caps event to notify downstream elements of the current media type. \nVarious methods exist to work with the media types such as subtracting or intersecting. \nBe aware that the current Gst.Caps Gst.Structure serialization into string has limited support for nested Gst.Caps Gst.Structure fields. It can only support one level of nesting. Using more levels will lead to unexpected behavior when using serialization features such as Gst.Caps.prototype.to_string or Gst.prototype.value_serialize and their counterparts. \n"});
