It is possible to make this wait be controlled by specifying true for the controllable flag when creating the set or later calling Gst.Poll.prototype.set_controllable \nNew file descriptors are added to the set using Gst.Poll.prototype.add_fd and removed using Gst.Poll.prototype.remove_fd. Controlling which file descriptors should be waited for to become readable and or writable are done using Gst.Poll.prototype.fd_ctl_read and Gst.Poll.prototype.fd_ctl_write. \nUse Gst.Poll.prototype.wait to wait for the file descriptors to actually become readable and or writable or to timeout if no file descriptor is available in time. The wait can be controlled by calling Gst.Poll.prototype.restart and Gst.Poll.prototype.set_flushing. \nOnce the file descriptor set has been waited for one can use Gst.Poll.prototype.fd_has_closed to see if the file descriptor has been closed Gst.Poll.prototype.fd_has_error to see if it has generated an error Gst.Poll.prototype.fd_can_read to see if it is possible to read from the file descriptor and Gst.Poll.prototype.fd_can_write to see if it is possible to write to it. \n"});
