fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/javascript/gstregistry.html#gst_update_registry", "fragment": "Gst.prototype.update_registry \nForces GStreamer to re scan its plugin paths and update the default plugin registry. \nApplications will almost never need to call this function it is only useful if the application knows new plugins have been installed or old ones removed since the start of the application or to be precise the first call to Gst.prototype.init and the application wants to make use of any newly installed plugins without restarting the application. \nApplications should assume that the registry update is neither atomic nor thread safe and should therefore not have any dynamic pipelines running including the playbin and decodebin elements and should also not create any elements or access the GStreamer registry while the update is in progress. \nNote that this function may block for a significant amount of time. \ntrue if the registry has been updated successfully does not imply that there were changes otherwise false. \n"});
