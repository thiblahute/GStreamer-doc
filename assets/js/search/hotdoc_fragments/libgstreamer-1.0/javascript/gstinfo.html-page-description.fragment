Debug information will only be output if the threshold is lower or equal to the level of the debugging message. \nDo not use this function in production code because other functions may change the threshold of categories as side effect. It is however a nice function to use when debugging even from gdb \nResets the threshold of the category to the default level. Debug information will only be output if the threshold is lower or equal to the level of the debugging message. Use this function to set the threshold back to where it was after using Gst.DebugCategory.prototype.set_threshold. \nReturns the threshold of a Gst.DebugCategory. \nReturns the name of a debug category. \nReturns the color of a debug category used when printing output in this category. \nReturns the description of a debug category. \nAdds the logging function to the list of logging functions. Be sure to use G_GNUC_NO_INSTRUMENT not introspectable on that function it is needed. \nRemoves all registered instances of the given logging functions. \nSets the default threshold to the given level and updates all categories to use this threshold. \nThis function may be called before Gst.prototype.init. \nReturns the default threshold that is used for new categories. \nGet the string representation of a debugging level \nChanges the coloring mode for debug output. \nThis function may be called before Gst.prototype.init. \nChanges the coloring mode for debug output. \nThis function may be called before Gst.prototype.init. \nChanges the coloring mode for debug output. \nSets all categories which match the given glob style pattern to the given level. \nResets all categories with the given name back to the default level. \nReturns a snapshot of a all categories that are currently in use This list may change anytime. The caller has to free the list after use. \nConstructs a string that can be used for getting the desired color in color terminals. You need to free the string after use. \nConstructs an integer that can be used for getting the desired color in windows terminals cmd.exe As there is no mean to underline we simply ignore this attribute. \nThis function returns on non windows machines. \nIf libunwind or glibc backtrace are present a stack trace is returned. \nIf libunwind or glibc backtrace are present a stack trace is printed. \nRemoves all registered instances of log functions with the given user data. \nSets the debug logging wanted in the same form as with the GST_DEBUG environment variable. You can use wildcards such as but note that the order matters when you use wild cards e.g. foosrc src sets everything to log level \n"});
