However if you know the caps are writable either because you have just copied them or made them writable with gst_caps_make_writable not introspectable you may modify the structure returned in the usual way e.g. with functions like gst_structure_set not introspectable \nYou do not need to free or unref the structure returned it belongs to the Gst.Caps. \nParameters \na Gst.Caps \nthe index of the structure \na pointer to the Gst.Structure corresponding to index \n"});
