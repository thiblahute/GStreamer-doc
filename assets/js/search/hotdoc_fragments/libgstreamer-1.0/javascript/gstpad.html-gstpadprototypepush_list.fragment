If pad has no peer Gst.FlowReturn.prototype.not_linked will be returned. If the peer pad does not have any installed chainlist function every group buffer of the list will be merged into a normal Gst.Buffer and chained via Gst.Pad.prototype.chain. \nIn all cases success or failure the caller loses its reference to list after calling this function. \n"});
