Side effect is that if one of the pads has no parent it becomes a child of the parent of the other element. If they have different parents the link fails. \nCalling Gst.Element.prototype.link_pads_full with flags Gst.PadLinkCheck.prototype.default is the same as calling Gst.Element.prototype.link_pads and the recommended way of linking pads with safety checks applied. \nThis is a convenience function for Gst.Pad.prototype.link_full. \n"});
