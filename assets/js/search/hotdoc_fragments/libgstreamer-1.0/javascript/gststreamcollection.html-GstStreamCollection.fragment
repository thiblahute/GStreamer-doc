Applications can use the collection to show the user what streams are available by using Gst.StreamCollection.prototype.get_stream \nOnce posted a Gst.StreamCollection is immutable. Updates are made by sending a new Gst.StreamCollection message which may or may not share some of the Gst.Stream objects from the collection it replaces. The receiver can check the sender of a stream collection message to know which collection is obsoleted. \nSeveral elements in a pipeline can provide Gst.StreamCollection. \nApplications can activate streams from a collection by using the Gst.EventType.prototype.select_streams event on a pipeline bin or element. \n"});
