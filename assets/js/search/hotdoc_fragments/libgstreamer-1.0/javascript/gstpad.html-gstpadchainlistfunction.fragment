The function typically processes the data contained in the buffer list and either consumes the data or passes it on to the internally linked pad s \nThe implementer of this function receives a refcount to list and should gst_buffer_list_unref when the list is no longer needed. \nWhen a chainlist function detects an error in the data stream it must post an error on the bus and return an appropriate Gst.FlowReturn value. \n"});
