A preset is a bunch of property settings together with meta data and a name. The name of a preset serves as key for subsequent method calls to manipulate single presets. All instances of one type will share the list of presets. The list is created on demand if presets are not used the list is not created. \nThe interface comes with a default implementation that serves most plugins. Wrapper plugins will override most methods to implement support for the native preset format of those wrapped plugins. One method that is useful to be overridden is Gst.Preset.prototype.get_property_names. With that one can control which properties are saved and in which order. When implementing support for read only presets one should set the vmethods for Gst.Preset.prototype.save_preset and Gst.Preset.prototype.delete_preset to NULL. Applications can use Gst.Preset.prototype.is_editable to check for that. \nThe default implementation supports presets located in a system directory application specific directory and in the users home directory. When getting a list of presets individual presets are read and overlaid in system \n"});
