Free the date with GLib.Date.prototype.free when it is no longer needed. \nFree function g_date_free \nCopies the first datetime for the given tag in the taglist into the variable pointed to by value. Unref the date with Gst.DateTime.prototype.unref when it is no longer needed. \nFree function gst_date_time_unref \nGets the datetime that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list and copies it into the variable pointed to by value. Unref the datetime with Gst.DateTime.prototype.unref when it is no longer needed. \nFree function gst_date_time_unref \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nCopies the contents for the given tag into the value merging multiple values into one if multiple values are associated with the tag. \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGets the sample that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list and copies it into the variable pointed to by sample. Free the sample with gst_sample_unref not introspectable when it is no longer needed. You can retrieve the buffer from the sample using Gst.Sample.prototype.get_buffer and the associated caps if any with Gst.Sample.prototype.get_caps. \nFree function gst_sample_unref \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nThe resulting string in value will be in UTF encoding and should be freed by the caller using g_free when no longer needed. The returned string is also guaranteed to be non NULL and non empty. \nFree function g_free \nChecks how many value are stored in this tag list for the given tag. \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGets the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nGet the name of the tag in list at index. \nPeeks at the value that is at the given index for the given tag in the given list. \nThe resulting string in value will be in UTF encoding and doesn t need to be freed by the caller. The returned string is also guaranteed to be non NULL and non empty. \nCopies the contents for the given tag into the value merging multiple values into one if multiple values are associated with the tag. You must GObject.Value.prototype.unset the value after use. \nReturns the human readable description of this tag You must not change or free this string. \nThis is a convenience function for the func argument of Gst.prototype.tag_register. It concatenates all given strings using a comma. The tag must be registered as a G_TYPE_STRING or this function will fail. \nThis is a convenience function for the func argument of Gst.prototype.tag_register. It creates a copy of the first value from the list. \nRegisters a new tag type for the use with GStreamer s type system. \nSame as Gst.prototype.tag_register but name nick and blurb must be static strings or inlined strings as they will not be copied. GStreamer plugins will be made resident once loaded so this function can be used even from dynamically loaded plugins. \nA location smaller than GST_TAG_GEO_LOCATION_CITY that specifies better where the media has been produced. e.g. the neighborhood string \nThis tag has been added as this is how it is handled named in XMP s Iptc4xmpcore schema. \nRepresents the expected error on the horizontal positioning in meters double \nSpeed of the capturing device when performing the capture. Represented in m s. double \nSee also Gst.TAG_GEO_LOCATION_MOVEMENT_DIRECTION \nIndicates the movement direction of the device performing the capture of a media. It is represented as degrees in floating point representation means the geographic north and increases clockwise double from to \nSee also Gst.TAG_GEO_LOCATION_CAPTURE_DIRECTION \nIndicates the direction the device is pointing to when capturing a media. It is represented as degrees in floating point representation means the geographic north and increases clockwise double from to \nSee also Gst.TAG_GEO_LOCATION_MOVEMENT_DIRECTION \n"});
