Position is a value between segment start and stop time. \nThis function is typically used by elements that need to synchronize to the global clock in a pipeline. The running time is a constantly increasing value starting from When Gst.Segment.prototype.init is called this value will reset to \nThis function returns if the position is outside of segment start and stop. \nTranslate position to the total running time using the currently configured segment. Compared to Gst.Segment.prototype.to_running_time this function can return negative running time. \nThis function is typically used by elements that need to synchronize buffers against the clock or eachother. \nposition can be any value and the result of this function for values outside of the segment is extrapolated. \nWhen is returned position resulted in a positive running time returned in running_time. \nWhen this function returns the returned running_time should be negated to get the real negative running time. \nTranslate position to stream time using the currently configured segment. The position value must be between segment start and stop value. \nThis function is typically used by elements that need to operate on the stream time of the buffers it receives such as effect plugins. In those use cases position is typically the buffer timestamp or clock time that one wants to convert to the stream time. The stream time is always between and the total duration of the media stream. \nTranslate position to the total stream time using the currently configured segment.
