If enough observations are available a linear regression algorithm is run on the observations and clock is recalibrated. \nIf this functions returns true r_squared will contain the correlation coefficient of the interpolation. A value of means a perfect regression was performed. This value can be used to control the sampling frequency of the master and slave clocks. \nParameters \na Gst.Clock \na time on the slave \na time on the master \nReturns a tuple made of \ntrue if enough observations were added to run the regression algorithm. \nMT safe. \ntrue if enough observations were added to run the regression algorithm. \nMT safe. \n"});
