This information is then used to clip media to the segment boundaries. \nA segment structure is initialized with Gst.Segment.prototype.init which takes a Gst.Format that will be used as the format of the segment values. The segment will be configured with a start value of and a stop duration of which is undefined. The default rate and applied_rate is \nThe public duration field contains the duration of the segment. When using the segment for seeking the start and time members should normally be left to their default value. The stop position is left to unless explicitly configured to a different value after a seek event. \nThe current position in the segment should be set by changing the position member in the structure. \nFor elements that perform seeks the current segment should be updated with the Gst.Segment.prototype.do_seek and the values from the seek event. This method will update all the segment fields. The position field will contain the new playback position. If the start_type was different from GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE playback continues from the position position possibly with updated flags or rate. \nFor elements that want to use Gst.Segment to track the playback region update the segment fields with the information from the newsegment event. The Gst.Segment.prototype.clip method can be used to check and clip the media data to the segment boundaries. \nFor elements that want to synchronize to the pipeline clock Gst.Segment.prototype.to_running_time can be used to convert a timestamp to a value that can be used to synchronize to the clock. This function takes into account the base as well as any rate or applied_rate conversions. \nFor elements that need to perform operations on media data in stream_time Gst.Segment.prototype.to_stream_time can be used to convert a timestamp and the segment info to stream time which is always between and the duration of the stream \n"});
