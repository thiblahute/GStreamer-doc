fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/javascript/gstmessage.html#gst_message_new_redirect", "fragment": "Gst.Message.prototype.new_redirect \nCreates a new redirect message and adds a new entry to it. Redirect messages are posted when an element detects that the actual data has to be retrieved from a different location. This is useful if such a redirection cannot be handled inside a source element for example when HTTP redirects return a non HTTP URL. \nThe redirect message can hold multiple entries. The first one is added when the redirect message is created with the given location tag_list entry_struct arguments. Use Gst.Message.prototype.add_redirect_entry to add more entries. \nEach entry has a location a tag list and a structure. All of these are optional. The tag list and structure are useful for additional metadata such as bitrate statistics for the given location. \nBy default message recipients should treat entries in the order they are stored. The recipient should therefore try entry first and if this entry is not acceptable or working try entry etc. Senders must make sure that they add entries in this order. However recipients are free to ignore the order and pick an entry that is best for them. One example would be a recipient that scans the entries for the one with the highest bitrate tag. \nThe specified location string is copied. However ownership over the tag list and structure are transferred to the message. \nParameters \nThe Gst.Object whose property changed may or may not be a Gst.Element \nlocation string for the new entry \ntag list for the new entry \nstructure for the new entry \na newly allocated Gst.Message \nSince \n"});
