For more complex operations like segment seeks e.g. for looping or changing the playback rate or seeking relative to the last configured playback segment you should use Gst.Element.prototype.seek. \nIn a completely prerolled PAUSED or PLAYING pipeline seeking is always guaranteed to return true on a seekable media type or false when the media type is certainly not seekable such as a live stream \nSome elements allow for seeking in the READY state in this case they will store the seek event and execute it when they are put to PAUSED. If the element supports seek in READY it will always return true when it receives the event in the READY state. \n"});
