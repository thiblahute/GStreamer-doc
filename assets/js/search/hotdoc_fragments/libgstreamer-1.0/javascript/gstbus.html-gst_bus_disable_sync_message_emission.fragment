See Gst.Bus.prototype.enable_sync_message_emission for more information. \nIn the event that multiple pieces of code have called Gst.Bus.prototype.enable_sync_message_emission the sync message emissions will only be stopped after all calls to Gst.Bus.prototype.enable_sync_message_emission were cancelled by calling this function. In this way the semantics are exactly the same as Gst.Object.prototype.ref that which calls enable should also call disable. \nMT safe. \nParameters \na Gst.Bus on which you previously called Gst.Bus.prototype.enable_sync_message_emission \n"});
