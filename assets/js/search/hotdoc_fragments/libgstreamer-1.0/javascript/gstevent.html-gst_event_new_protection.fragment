The functions defined here enable this information to be passed in events from elements that extract it e.g. ISOBMFF demuxers MPEG DASH demuxers to protection decrypter elements that use it. \nEvents containing protection system specific information are created using Gst.Event.prototype.new_protection and they can be parsed by downstream elements using Gst.Event.prototype.parse_protection. \nIn Common Encryption protection system specific information may be located within ISOBMFF files both in movie moov boxes and movie fragment moof boxes it may also be contained in ContentProtection elements within MPEG DASH MPDs. The events created by Gst.Event.prototype.new_protection contain data identifying from which of these locations the encapsulated protection system specific information originated. This origin information is required as some protection systems use different encodings depending upon where the information originates. \nThe events returned by Gst.Event.prototype.new_protection are implemented in such a way as to ensure that the most recently pushed protection info event of a particular origin and system_id will be stuck to the output pad of the sending element. \nsystem_id \na string holding a UUID that uniquely identifies a protection system. \ndata \na Gst.Buffer holding protection system specific information. The reference count of the buffer will be incremented by one. \norigin \na string indicating where the protection information carried in the event was extracted from. The allowed values of this string will depend upon the protection scheme. \n\na Gst.EventType.prototype.protection event if successful null if unsuccessful. \nSince \n"});
