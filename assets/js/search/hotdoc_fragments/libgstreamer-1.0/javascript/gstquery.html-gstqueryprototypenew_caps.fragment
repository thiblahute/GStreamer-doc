These caps must be a subset of the pad template caps. In the NULL state with no links the CAPS query should ideally return the same caps as the pad template. In rare circumstances an object property can affect the caps returned by the CAPS query but this is discouraged. \nFor most filters the caps returned by CAPS query is directly affected by the allowed caps on other pads. For demuxers and decoders the caps returned by the srcpad s getcaps function is directly related to the stream data. Again the CAPS query should return the most specific caps it reasonably can since this helps with autoplugging. \nThe filter is used to restrict the result caps only the caps matching filter should be returned from the CAPS query. Specifying a filter might greatly reduce the amount of processing an element needs to do. \nFree function gst_query_unref \n"});
