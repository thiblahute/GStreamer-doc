When the pool is inactive new calls to Gst.BufferPool.prototype.acquire_buffer will return with Gst.FlowReturn.prototype.flushing. \nActivating the bufferpool will preallocate all resources in the pool based on the configuration of the pool. \nDeactivating will free the resources again when there are no outstanding buffers. When there are outstanding buffers they will be freed as soon as they are all returned to the pool. \n"});
