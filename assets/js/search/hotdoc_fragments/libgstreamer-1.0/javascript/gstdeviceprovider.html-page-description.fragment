This may actually probe the hardware if the provider is not currently started. \nRetrieves the factory that was used to create this device provider. \nGet the provider factory names of the Gst.DeviceProvider instances that are hidden by provider. \nMake provider hide the devices from the factory with name. \nThis function is used when provider will also provide the devices reported by provider factory name. A monitor should stop monitoring the device provider with name to avoid duplicate devices. \nStarts providering the devices. This will cause Gst.MessageType.prototype.device_added and Gst.MessageType.prototype.device_removed messages to be posted on the provider s bus when devices are added or removed from the system. \nSince the Gst.DeviceProvider is a singleton Gst.DeviceProvider.prototype.start may already have been called by another user of the object Gst.DeviceProvider.prototype.stop needs to be called the same number of times. \nDecreases the use count by one. If the use count reaches zero this Gst.DeviceProvider will stop providering the devices. This needs to be called the same number of times that Gst.DeviceProvider.prototype.start was called. \nMake provider unhide the devices from factory name. \nThis function is used when provider will no longer provide the devices reported by provider factory name. A monitor should start monitoring the devices from provider factory name in order to see all devices again. \nGstDeviceProviderFactory factory \na pointer to the GstDeviceProviderFactory that creates this provider \ngpointer metadata \ngpointer _gst_reserved \nSet key with value as metadata in klass. \nSet key with value as metadata in klass. \nSame as Gst.DeviceProviderClass.prototype.add_metadata but value must be a static string or an inlined string as it will not be copied. GStreamer plugins will be made resident once loaded so this function can be used even from dynamically loaded plugins. \nGet metadata with key in klass. \nSets the detailed information for a Gst.DeviceProviderClass. \nThis function is for use in _class_init functions only. \nSets the detailed information for a Gst.DeviceProviderClass. \nThis function is for use in _class_init functions only. \nSame as Gst.DeviceProviderClass.prototype.set_metadata but longname classification description and author must be static strings or inlined strings as they will not be copied. GStreamer plugins will be made resident once loaded so this function can be used even from dynamically loaded plugins. \n"});
