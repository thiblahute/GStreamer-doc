There can only be a single bus watch per bus you must remove it before you can set a new one. \nThe bus watch will only work if a GLib main loop is being run. \nWhen func is called the message belongs to the caller if you want to keep a copy of it call gst_message_ref not introspectable before leaving func. \nThe watch can be removed using Gst.Bus.prototype.remove_watch or by returning false from func. If the watch was added to the default main context it is also possible to remove the watch using GLib.prototype.source_remove. \nMT safe. \nParameters \na Gst.Bus to create the watch for. \nThe priority of the watch. \nA function to call when a message is received. \nuser data passed to func. \nthe function to call when the source is removed. \nThe event source id or if bus already got an event source. \n"});
