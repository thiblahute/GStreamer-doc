The new requested position in the segment depends on rate and start_type and stop_type. \nFor positive rate the new position in the segment is the new segment start field when it was updated with a start_type different from Gst.SeekType.none. If no update was performed on segment start position GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE start is ignored and segment position is unmodified. \nFor negative rate the new position in the segment is the new segment stop field when it was updated with a stop_type different from Gst.SeekType.none. If no stop was previously configured in the segment the duration of the segment will be used to update the stop position. If no update was performed on segment stop position GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE stop is ignored and segment position is unmodified. \nThe applied rate of the segment will be set to by default. If the caller can apply a rate change it should update segment rate and applied_rate after calling this function. \nupdate will be set to true if a seek should be performed to the segment position field. This field can be false if for example only the rate has been changed but not the playback position. \nParameters \na Gst.Segment structure. \nthe rate of the segment. \nthe format of the segment. \nthe segment flags for the segment \nthe seek method \nthe seek start value \nthe seek method \nthe seek stop value \nReturns a tuple made of \ntrue if the seek could be performed. \ntrue if the seek could be performed. \n"});
