It is currently a thin wrapper on top of GInitiallyUnowned. It is an abstract class that is not very usable on its own. \nGst.Object gives us basic refcounting parenting functionality and locking. Most of the functions are just extended for special GStreamer needs and can be found under the same name in the base class of Gst.Object which is GObject e.g. GObject.Object.prototype.ref becomes Gst.Object.prototype.ref \nSince Gst.Object derives from GInitiallyUnowned it also inherits the floating reference. Be aware that functions such as Gst.Bin.prototype.add and Gst.Element.prototype.add_pad take ownership of the floating reference. \nIn contrast to GObject instances Gst.Object adds a name property. The functions Gst.Object.prototype.set_name and Gst.Object.prototype.get_name are used to set get the name of the object. \n"});
