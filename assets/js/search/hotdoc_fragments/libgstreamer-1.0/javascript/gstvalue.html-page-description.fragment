Two values will produce a valid intersection if they have the same type. \nChecks if it s possible to subtract subtrahend from minuend. \nMultiplies the two GObject.Value items containing a GST_TYPE_FRACTION not introspectable and sets product to the product of the two fractions. \nSubtracts the subtrahend from the minuend and sets dest to the result. \nGets the contents of value. \nGets the maximum of the range specified by value. \nGets the minimum of the range specified by value. \nRetrieve the flags field of a GstFlagSet value. \nRetrieve the mask field of a GstFlagSet value. \nGets the denominator of the fraction specified by value. \nGets the numerator of the fraction specified by value. \nGets the maximum of the range specified by value. \nGets the minimum of the range specified by value. \nGets the maximum of the range specified by value. \nGets the minimum of the range specified by value. \nGets the step of the range specified by value. \nGets the maximum of the range specified by value. \nGets the minimum of the range specified by value. \nGets the step of the range specified by value. \nGets the contents of value. \nInitialises the target value to be of the same type as source and then copies the contents from source to target. \nSets the contents of value to features. \nSets value to the range specified by start and end. \nSets value to the fraction specified by numerator over denominator. The fraction gets reduced to the smallest numerator and denominator and if necessary the sign is moved to the numerator. \nSets value to the range specified by start and end. \nSets value to the range specified by numerator_start denominator_start and numerator_end denominator_end. \nSets value to the range specified by start and end. \nSets value to the range specified by start end and step. \nSets value to the range specified by start and end. \nSets value to the range specified by start end and step. \nSets the contents of value to structure. \n"});
