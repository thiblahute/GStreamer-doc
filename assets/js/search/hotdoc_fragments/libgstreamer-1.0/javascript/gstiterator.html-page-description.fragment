This happens often for the Gst.PadIterIntLinkFunction. \nFind the first element in it that matches the compare function func. func should return when the element is found. The first parameter to func will be the current element of the iterator and the second parameter will be user_data. The result will be stored in elem if a result is found. \nThe iterator will not be freed. \nThis function will return false if an error happened to the iterator or if the element wasn t found. \n"});
