Refs the returned element factory caller is responsible for unreffing. \nFilter out all the elementfactories in list that can handle caps in the given direction. \nIf subsetonly is true then only the elements whose pads templates are a complete superset of caps will be returned. Else any element whose pad templates caps can intersect with caps will be returned. \nGet a list of factories that match the given type. Only elements with a rank greater or equal to minrank will be returned. The list of factories is returned by decreasing rank. \nCreate a new element of the type defined by the given element factory. If name is null then the element will receive a guaranteed unique name consisting of the element factory name and a number. If name is given it will be given the name supplied. \nChecks if the factory can sink all possible capabilities. \nChecks if the factory can sink any possible capability. \nChecks if the factory can src all possible capabilities. \nChecks if the factory can src any possible capability. \nCreate a new element of the type defined by the given elementfactory. It will be given the name supplied since all elements require a name as their first argument. \nGet the GObject.Type for elements managed by this factory. The type can only be retrieved if the element factory is loaded which can be assured with Gst.PluginFeature.prototype.load. \nGet the metadata on factory with key. \nGet the available keys for the metadata on factory. \nGets the number of pad_templates in this factory. \nGets the GLib.List of Gst.StaticPadTemplate for this factory. \nGets a null terminated array of protocols this element supports or null if no protocols are supported. You may not change the contents of the returned array as it is still owned by the element factory. Use g_strdupv not introspectable to make a copy of the protocol string array if you need to. \nGets the type of URIs the element supports or Gst.URIType.prototype.unknown if none. \nCheck if factory implements the interface with name interfacename. \nCheck if factory is of the given types. \nElements matching any of the defined GST_ELEMENT_FACTORY_TYPE_MEDIA types \nNote Do not use this if you wish to not filter against any of the defined media types. If you wish to do this simply don t specify any GST_ELEMENT_FACTORY_TYPE_MEDIA flag. \nAll encoders handling video or image media types \nAll encoders handling audio media types \nAll sinks handling audio video or image media types \nAll elements used to decode streams decoders demuxers parsers depayloaders \n"});
