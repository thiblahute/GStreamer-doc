It works by using time stamped value pairs that are queued for element properties. At run time the elements continuously pull value changes for the current stream time. \nWhat needs to be changed in a Gst.Element Very little it is just two steps to make a plugin controllable \nmark gobject properties paramspecs that make sense to be controlled by GST_PARAM_CONTROLLABLE. \nwhen processing data get chain loop function at the beginning call gst_object_sync_values element timestamp This will make the controller update all GObject properties that are under its control with the current values based on the timestamp. \nWhat needs to be done in applications Again it s not a lot to change. \ncreate a Gst.ControlSource. csource gst_interpolation_control_source_new g_object_set csource mode GST_INTERPOLATION_MODE_LINEAR NULL \nAttach the Gst.ControlSource on the controller to a property. gst_object_add_control_binding object gst_direct_control_binding_new object prop1 csource \nSet the control values gst_timed_value_control_source_set GstTimedValueControlSource csource GST_SECOND value1 gst_timed_value_control_source_set GstTimedValueControlSource csource GST_SECOND value2 \nstart your pipeline \n"});
