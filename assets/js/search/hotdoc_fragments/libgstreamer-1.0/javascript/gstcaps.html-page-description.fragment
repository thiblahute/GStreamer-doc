Caller is responsible for unreffing the returned caps. \nAppends structure to caps. The structure is not copied caps becomes the owner of structure. \nAppends structure with features to caps. The structure is not copied caps becomes the owner of structure. \nCalls the provided function once for each structure and caps feature in the Gst.Caps. In contrast to Gst.Caps.prototype.foreach the function may modify the structure and features. In contrast to Gst.Caps.prototype.filter_and_map_in_place the structure and features are removed from the caps if false is returned from the function. The caps must be mutable. \nCreates a new Gst.Caps that contains all the formats that are common to both caps1 and caps2 the order is defined by the Gst.CapsIntersectMode used. \nA given Gst.Caps structure is always compatible with another if every media format that is in the first is also contained in the second. That is caps1 is a subset of caps2. \nTests if two Gst.Caps are equal. This function only works on fixed Gst.Caps. \nChecks if the given caps are exactly the same set of caps. \nChecks if structure is a subset of caps. See Gst.Caps.prototype.is_subset for more information. \nChecks if structure is a subset of caps. See Gst.Caps.prototype.is_subset for more information. \nAppends structure to caps if its not already expressed by caps. \nAppends structure with features to caps if its not already expressed by caps. \nremoves the structure with the given index from the list of structures contained in caps. \nRetrieves the structure with the given index from the list of structures contained in caps. The caller becomes the owner of the returned structure. \n"});
