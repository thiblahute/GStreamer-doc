The start and stop values are expressed in format. \nA rate of means normal playback rate means double speed. Negatives values means backwards playback. A value of for the rate is not allowed and should be accomplished instead by PAUSING the pipeline. \nA pipeline has a default playback segment configured with a start position of a stop position of and a rate of The currently configured playback segment can be queried with Gst.QueryType.prototype.segment. \nstart_type and stop_type specify how to adjust the currently configured start and stop fields in playback segment. Adjustments can be made relative or absolute to the last configured values. A type of Gst.SeekType.prototype.none means that the position should not be updated. \nWhen the rate is positive and start has been updated playback will start from the newly configured start position. \nFor negative rates playback will start from the newly configured stop position if any If the stop position is updated it must be different from GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE for negative rates. \nIt is not possible to seek relative to the current playback position to do this PAUSE the pipeline query the current playback position with Gst.QueryType.prototype.position and update the playback segment current position with a Gst.SeekType.prototype.set to the desired position. \n"});
