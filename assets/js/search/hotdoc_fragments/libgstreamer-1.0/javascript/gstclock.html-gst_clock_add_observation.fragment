If enough observations are available a linear regression algorithm is run on the observations and clock is recalibrated. \nIf this functions returns TRUE r_squared will contain the correlation coefficient of the interpolation. A value of means a perfect regression was performed. This value can be used to control the sampling frequency of the master and slave clocks. \n"});
