Subclasses can access these fields provided the LOCK is taken. \nRecursively looks for elements with an unlinked pad of the given direction within the specified bin and returns an unlinked pad if one is found or null otherwise. If a pad is found the caller owns a reference to it and should use Gst.Object.prototype.unref on the pad when it is not needed any longer. \nLooks for an element inside the bin that implements the given interface. If such an element is found it returns the element. You can cast this element to the given interface afterwards. If you want all elements that implement the interface use Gst.Bin.prototype.iterate_all_by_interface. This function recurses into child bins. \nMT safe. Caller owns returned reference. \nGets the element with the given name from this bin. If the element is not found a recursion is performed on the parent bin. \nReturns null if \nMT safe. Caller owns returned reference. \nReturn the suppressed flags of the bin. \nMT safe. \nLooks for all elements inside the bin that implements the given interface. You can safely cast all returned elements to the given interface. The function recurses inside child bins. The iterator will yield a series of Gst.Element that should be unreffed after use. \nMT safe. Caller owns returned value. \nGets an iterator for the elements in this bin. \nMT safe. Caller owns returned value. \nGets an iterator for the elements in this bin. This iterator recurses into GstBin children. \nMT safe. Caller owns returned value. \nGets an iterator for all elements in the bin that have the Gst.ElementFlags.prototype.source flag set. \nMT safe. Caller owns returned value. \nQuery bin for the current latency using and reconfigures this latency to all the elements with a LATENCY event. \nThis method is typically called on the pipeline when a Gst.MessageType.prototype.latency is posted on the bus. \nThis function simply emits the do latency signal so any custom latency calculations will be performed. \nSuppress the given flags on the bin. Gst.ElementFlags of a child element are propagated when it is added to the bin. When suppressed flags are set those specified flags will not be propagated to the bin. \nMT safe. \nSynchronizes the state of every child of bin with the state of bin. See also Gst.Element.prototype.sync_state_with_parent. \n"});
