Audio processing Gst.Element objects will use this rate to sub divide their processing loop and call Gst.Object.prototype.sync_values inbetween. The length of the processing segment should be up to control rate nanoseconds. \nIf the object is not under property control this will return Gst.CLOCK_TIME_NONE. This allows the element to avoid the sub dividing. \nThe control rate is not expected to change if the element is in Gst.State.prototype.paused or Gst.State.prototype.playing. \n"});
