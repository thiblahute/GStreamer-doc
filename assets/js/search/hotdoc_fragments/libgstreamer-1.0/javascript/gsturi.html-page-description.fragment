fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstreamer-1.0/javascript/gsturi.html#page-description", "fragment": "Gets the list of protocols supported by handler. This list may not be modified. \nGets the type of the given URI handler \nAppend a single path segment onto the end of the URI path. \nLike Gst.prototype.uri_from_string but also joins with a base URI. \nGet the media fragment table from the URI as defined by Media Fragments URI Hash table returned by this API is a list of key value pairs and the each pair is generated by splitting URI fragment per sub delims then key and value are splitted by sub delims. The key returned by this API may be undefined keyword by standard. A value may be null to indicate that the key should appear in the fragment string in the URI but does not have a value. Free the returned GLib.HashTable with GLib.prototype.hash_table_unref when it is no longer required. Modifying this hash table does not affect the fragment in the URI. \nSee more about Media Fragments URI W3C at https www.w3.org TR media frags \nGet a list of path segments from the URI. \nExtract the path string from the URI object as a percent encoded URI path. \nGet a percent encoded URI query string from the uri. \nGet the query table from the URI. Keys and values in the table are freed with g_free when they are deleted. A value may be null to indicate that the key should appear in the query string in the URI but does not have a value. Free the returned GLib.HashTable with GLib.prototype.hash_table_unref when it is no longer required. Modifying this hash table will modify the query in the URI. \nGet the value associated with the query_key key. Will return null if the key has no value or if the key does not exist in the URI query table. Because null is returned for both missing keys and keys with no value you should use Gst.Uri.prototype.query_has_key to determine if a key is present in the URI query. \nRemove an entry from the query table by key. \nReplace the path segments list in the URI. \nSets or unsets the path in the URI. \nSets or unsets the query table in the URI. \nSet the query table to use in the URI. The old table is unreferenced and a reference to the new one is used instead. A value if null for query_table will remove the query string from the URI. \nThis inserts or replaces a key in the query table. A query_value of null indicates that the key has no associated value but will still be present in the query string. \nChecks if an element exists that supports the given URI protocol. Note that a positive return value does not imply that a subsequent call to Gst.Element.prototype.make_from_uri is guaranteed to work. \nTests if the given string is a valid protocol identifier. Protocols must consist of alphanumeric characters and and must start with a alphabetic character. See RFC Section \nThe protocol is not supported \nGst.URIError.prototype.bad_uri \n"});
