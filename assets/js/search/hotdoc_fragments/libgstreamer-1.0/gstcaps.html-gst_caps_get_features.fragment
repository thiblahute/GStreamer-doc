However if you know the caps are writable either because you have just copied them or made them writable with gst_caps_make_writable not introspectable you may modify the features returned in the usual way e.g. with functions like Gst.prototype.add. \nYou do not need to free or unref the structure returned it belongs to the Gst.Caps. \nParameters \na Gst.Caps \nthe index of the structure \na pointer to the Gst.CapsFeatures corresponding to index \nSince \nFinds the features in caps that has the index index and returns it. \nWARNING This function takes a const GstCaps but returns a non const GstCapsFeatures This is for programming convenience the caller should be aware that structures inside a constant GstCaps should not be modified.
