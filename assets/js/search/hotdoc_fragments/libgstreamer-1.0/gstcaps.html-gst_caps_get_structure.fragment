However if you know the caps are writable either because you have just copied them or made them writable with gst_caps_make_writable you may modify the structure returned in the usual way e.g. with functions like gst_structure_set. \nYou do not need to free or unref the structure returned it belongs to the GstCaps. \nParameters \na GstCaps \nthe index of the structure \na pointer to the GstStructure corresponding to index \nFinds the structure in caps that has the index index and returns it. \nWARNING This function takes a const GstCaps but returns a non const GstStructure This is for programming convenience the caller should be aware that structures inside a constant Gst.Caps should not be modified.
