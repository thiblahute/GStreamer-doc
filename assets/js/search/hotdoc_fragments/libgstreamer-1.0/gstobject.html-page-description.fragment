It is currently a thin wrapper on top of GInitiallyUnowned. It is an abstract class that is not very usable on its own. \nGstObject gives us basic refcounting parenting functionality and locking. Most of the functions are just extended for special GStreamer needs and can be found under the same name in the base class of GstObject which is GObject e.g. g_object_ref becomes gst_object_ref \nSince GstObject derives from GInitiallyUnowned it also inherits the floating reference. Be aware that functions such as gst_bin_add and gst_element_add_pad take ownership of the floating reference. \nIn contrast to GObject instances GstObject adds a name property. The functions gst_object_set_name and gst_object_get_name are used to set get the name of the object. \nControlled properties offers a lightweight way to adjust gobject properties over stream time. It works by using time stamped value pairs that are queued for element properties. At run time the elements continuously pull value changes for the current stream time. \nWhat needs to be changed in a GstElement Very little it is just two steps to make a plugin controllable \nmark gobject properties paramspecs that make sense to be controlled by GST_PARAM_CONTROLLABLE. \nwhen processing data get chain loop function at the beginning call gst_object_sync_values element timestamp This will make the controller update all GObject properties that are under its control with the current values based on the timestamp. \nWhat needs to be done in applications Again it s not a lot to change. \ncreate a GstControlSource. csource gst_interpolation_control_source_new g_object_set csource mode GST_INTERPOLATION_MODE_LINEAR NULL \nAttach the GstControlSource on the controller to a property. gst_object_add_control_binding object gst_direct_control_binding_new object prop1 csource \nSet the control values gst_timed_value_control_source_set GstTimedValueControlSource csource GST_SECOND value1 gst_timed_value_control_source_set GstTimedValueControlSource csource GST_SECOND value2 \nstart your pipeline \n"});
