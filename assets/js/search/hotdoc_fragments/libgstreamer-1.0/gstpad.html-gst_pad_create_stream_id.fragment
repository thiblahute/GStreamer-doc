If the element has no sinkpad it will generate an upstream stream id by doing an URI query on the element and in the worst case just uses a random number. Source elements that don t implement the URI handler interface should ideally generate a unique deterministic stream id manually instead. \nSince stream IDs are sorted alphabetically any numbers in the stream ID should be printed with a fixed number of characters preceded by s such as by using the format u instead of u. \nParameters \nA source GstPad \nParent GstElement of pad \nThe stream id \nA stream id for pad. g_free after usage. \nCreates a stream id for the source Gst.Pad pad by combining the upstream information with the optional stream_id of the stream of pad. pad must have a parent Gst.Element and which must have zero or one sinkpad. stream_id can only be None if the parent element of pad has only a single source pad. \nThis function generates an unique stream id by getting the upstream stream start event stream ID and appending stream_id to it.
