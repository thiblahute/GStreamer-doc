If this function returns GST_FLOW_OK the result buffer will be stored in buffer. The contents of buffer is invalid for any other return value. \nThis function is installed on a source pad with gst_pad_set_getrange_function and can only be called on source pads after they are successfully activated with gst_pad_activate_mode with the GST_PAD_MODE_PULL. \noffset and length are always given in byte units. offset must normally be a value between and the length in bytes of the data available on pad. The length duration in bytes can be retrieved with a GST_QUERY_DURATION or with a GST_QUERY_SEEKING. \nAny offset larger or equal than the length will make the function return GST_FLOW_EOS which corresponds to EOS. In this case buffer does not contain a valid buffer. \nThe buffer size of buffer will only be smaller than length when offset is near the end of the stream. In all other cases the size of buffer must be exactly the requested size. \nIt is allowed to call this function with a length and valid offset in which case buffer will contain a sized buffer and the function returns GST_FLOW_OK. \nWhen this function is called with a offset the sequentially next buffer of length length in the stream is returned. \nWhen this function is called with a length a buffer with a default optimal length is returned in buffer. The length might depend on the value of offset. \nParameters \nthe src GstPad to perform the getrange on. \nthe parent of pad.
