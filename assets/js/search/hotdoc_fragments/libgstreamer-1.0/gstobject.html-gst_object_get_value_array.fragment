The array values need to hold enough space for n_values of the same type as the objects property s type. \nThis function is useful if one wants to e.g. draw a graph of the control curve or apply a control curve sample by sample. \nThe values are unboxed and ready to be used. The similar function gst_object_get_g_value_array returns the array as GValue and is better suites for bindings. \nParameters \nthe object that has controlled properties \nthe name of the property to get \nthe time that should be processed \nthe time spacing between subsequent values \nthe number of values \narray to put control values in \nTRUE if the given array could be filled FALSE otherwise \n"});
