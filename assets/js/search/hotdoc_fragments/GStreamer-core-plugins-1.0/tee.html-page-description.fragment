Branching the data flow is useful when e.g. capturing a video where the video is shown on the screen and also encoded and written to a file. Another example is playing music and hooking up a visualisation module. \nOne needs to use separate queue elements or a multiqueue in each branch to provide separate threads for each branch. Otherwise a blocked dataflow in one branch would stall the other branches. \nPlay song.ogg audio file which must be in the current working directory and render visualisations using the goom element this can be easier done using the playbin element this is just an example pipeline \n"});
