Then the next stream is enabled while keeping the running time continous for GST_FORMAT_TIME segments or keeping the segment continous for GST_FORMAT_BYTES segments. \nStreams are switched in the order in which the sinkpads were requested. \nBy default the stream segment s base values are adjusted to ensure the segment transitions between streams are continuous. In some cases it may be desirable to turn off these adjustments for example because another downstream element like a streamsynchronizer adjusts the base values on its own The adjust base property can be used for this purpose. \n"});
