Any attempt to push more buffers into the queue will block the pushing thread until more space becomes available. \nThe queue will create a new thread on the source pad to decouple the processing on sink and source pad. \nYou can query how many buffers are queued by reading the current level buffers property. You can track changes by connecting to the notify current level buffers signal which like all signals will be emitted from the streaming thread The same applies to the current level time and current level bytes properties. \nThe default queue size limits are buffers MB of data or one second worth of data whichever is reached first. \nAs said earlier the queue blocks by default when one of the specified maximums bytes time buffers has been reached. You can set the leaky property to specify that instead of blocking it should leak drop new or old buffers. \nThe underrun signal is emitted when the queue has less data than the specified minimum thresholds require by default when the queue is empty The overrun signal is emitted when the queue is filled up. Both signals are emitted from the context of the streaming thread. \n"});
