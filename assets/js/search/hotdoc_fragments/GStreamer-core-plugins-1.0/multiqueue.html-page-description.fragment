Any attempt to push more buffers into the queue will block the pushing thread until more space becomes available. extra size buffers \nextra size bytes and extra size time are currently unused. \nThe default queue size limits are buffers MB of data or two second worth of data whichever is reached first. Note that the number of buffers will dynamically grow depending on the fill level of other queues. \nThe underrun signal is emitted when all of the queues are empty. The overrun signal is emitted when one of the queues is filled. Both signals are emitted from the context of the streaming thread. \nWhen using sync by running time the unlinked streams will be throttled by the highest running time of linked streams. This allows further relinking of those unlinked streams without them being in the future i.e. to achieve gapless playback When dealing with streams which have got different consumption requirements downstream ex video decoders which will consume more buffer in time than audio decoders it is recommended to group streams of the same type by using the pad group id property. This will further throttle streams in time within that group. \n"});
