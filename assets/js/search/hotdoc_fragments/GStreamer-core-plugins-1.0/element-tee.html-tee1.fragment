Branching the data flow is useful when e.g. capturing a video where the video is shown on the screen and also encoded and written to a file. Another example is playing music and hooking up a visualisation module. \nOne needs to use separate queue elements or a multiqueue in each branch to provide separate threads for each branch. Otherwise a blocked dataflow in one branch would stall the other branches. \n"});
