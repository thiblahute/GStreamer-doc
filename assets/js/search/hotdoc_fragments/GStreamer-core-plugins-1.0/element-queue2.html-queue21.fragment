Any attempt to push more buffers into the queue will block the pushing thread until more space becomes available. \nThe queue will create a new thread on the source pad to decouple the processing on sink and source pad. \nYou can query how many buffers are queued by reading the current level buffers property. \nThe default queue size limits are buffers MB of data or two seconds worth of data whichever is reached first. \nIf you set temp template to a value such as tmp gstreamer XXXXXX the element will allocate a random free filename and buffer data in the file. By using this it will buffer the entire stream data on the file independently of the queue size limits they will only be used for buffering statistics. \nThe temp location property will be used to notify the application of the allocated filename. \n"});
