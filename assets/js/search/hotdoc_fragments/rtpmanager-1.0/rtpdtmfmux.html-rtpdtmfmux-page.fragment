It does exactly what its parent rtpmux does except that it prevent buffers coming over a regular sink_ u pad from going through for the duration of buffers that came in a priority_sink_ u pad. \nThis is especially useful if a discontinuous source like dtmfsrc or rtpdtmfsrc are connected to the priority sink pads. This way the generated DTMF signal can replace the recorded audio while the tone is being sent. \n"});
