The most generic way of doing this is to connect to playbin3 s source setup or notify source signal which will be emitted by playbin3 when it has created the source element for a particular URI. In the signal callback you can check if the source element has a device property and set it appropriately. In some cases the device can also be set as part of the URI but it depends on the elements involved if this will work or not. For example for DVD menu playback the following syntax might work if the resindvd plugin is used dvd path to device \n"});
