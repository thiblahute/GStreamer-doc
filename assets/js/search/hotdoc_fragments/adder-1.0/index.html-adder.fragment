Mixed data is clamped to the min max values of the data format. \nThe adder currently mixes all data received on the sinkpads as soon as possible without trying to synchronize the streams. \nCheck out the audiomixer element in gst plugins bad for a better behaving audio mixing element It will sync input streams correctly and also handle live inputs properly. \nCaps negotiation is inherently racy with the adder element. You can set the caps property to force adder to operate in a specific audio format sample rate and channel count. In this case you may also need audioconvert and or audioresample elements for each input stream before the adder element to make sure the input branch can produce the forced format. \nThis pipeline produces two sine waves mixed together. \n"});
