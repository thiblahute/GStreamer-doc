In case the system complains about the package not being signed you can control click it and open to start the installation. When you do this it will warn you but there is an option to install anyway. Otherwise you can go to System Preferences Security and Privacy General and select the option to allow installation of packages from anywhere \nThe GStreamer SDK installs itself in your home directory so it is available only to the user that installed it. The SDK library is installed to Library Developer GStreamer iPhone.sdk. Inside this directory there is the GStreamer.framework that contains the libs headers and resources and there is a Templates directory that has Xcode application templates for GStreamer development. Those templates are also copied to Library Developer Xcode Templates during installation so that Xcode can find them. \nGStreamer is written in C and the iOS API uses mostly Objective C and C for some parts but this should cause no problems as those languages interoperate freely. You can mix both in the same source code for example. \n"});
