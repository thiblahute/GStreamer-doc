Xcode\ncan be found at the App Store or\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action#downloads\">here</a>\nand the iOS SDK, if it is not already included in your version of Xcode,\ncan be downloaded from Xcode's preferences menu under the downloads tab.\nThe minimum required iOS version is 6.0. The minimum required version of\nXcode is 4, but 7.3 is recommended.</p>\n<p>In case you are not familiar with iOS, Objective-C or Xcode, we\nrecommend taking a look at the available documentation at Apple's\nwebsite.\n<a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhone101/Articles/00_Introduction.html\">This</a> can be a good starting point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"download-and-install-gstreamer-binaries\">Download and install GStreamer binaries</h2>\n<p>GStreamer binary installer can be found at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/ios/\">https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/ios/</a></p>\n<p>Double click the package file and follow the instructions presented by\nthe install wizard. In case the system complains about the package not\nbeing signed, you can control-click it and open to start the\ninstallation. When you do this, it will warn you, but there is an option\nto install anyway. Otherwise you can go to System Preferences \u2192\u00a0Security\nand Privacy \u2192\u00a0General and select the option to allow installation of\npackages from \"anywhere\".</p>\n<p>The GStreamer SDK installs itself in your home directory, so it is\navailable only to the user that installed it. The SDK library is\ninstalled to <code>~/Library/Developer/GStreamer/iPhone.sdk</code>. Inside this\ndirectory there is the GStreamer.framework that contains the libs,\nheaders and resources, and there is a <code>Templates</code>\u00a0directory that has\nXcode application templates for GStreamer development. Those templates\nare also copied to <code>~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates</code>\u00a0during\ninstallation so that Xcode can find them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure-your-development-environment\">Configure your development environment</h3>\n<p>GStreamer is written in C, and the iOS API uses mostly Objective-C (and\nC for some parts), but this should cause no problems as those languages\ninteroperate freely. You can mix both in the same source code, for\nexample.</p>\n<h4 id=\"building-the-tutorials\">Building the tutorials</h4>\n<p>The tutorials code are in the\n<a href=\"https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-docs/\">gst-docs</a> in the\n<code>examples/tutorials/xcode iOS</code> folder. We recommend that you open the project\nin Xcode, take a look at the sources and build them. This should\nconfirm that the installation works and give some insight on how\nsimple it is to mix Objective-C and C code.</p>\n<h4 id=\"creating-new-projects\">Creating new projects</h4>\n<p>After installation, when creating a new Xcode project, you should see\nthe GStreamer project templates under the <code>Templates</code>\u00a0category. OS X and\niOS have a different way of organizing libraries headers and binaries.\nThey are grouped into Frameworks, and that's how we ship GStreamer and\nits dependencies for iOS (and OS X). Due to this difference from\ntraditional linux development, we strongly recommend using the SDK\ntemplates, as they set a few variables on your project that allows Xcode\nto find, use and link GStreamer just like in traditional linux\ndevelopment. For example, if you don't use the templates, you'll have to\nuse:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;GStreamer/gst/gst.h&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>instead of the usual:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;gst/gst.h&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Among some other things the template does, this was a decision made to\nkeep development consistent across all the platforms the SDK supports.</p>\n<p>Once a project has been created using a GStreamer SDK Template, it is\nready to build and run. All necessary infrastructure is already in\nplace. To understand what files have been created and how they interact,\ntake a look at the <a href=\"../tutorials/ios/index.html\">iOS tutorials</a>.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
