You must define an environment variable called GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID and point it to the folder where you extracted the GStreamer binaries. This environment variable must be available at build time so maybe you want to make it available system wide by adding it to your profile file on Linux and Mac or to the Environment Variables in the System Properties dialog on Windows \nPoint GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID to the folder where you unzipped the binaries. \nIf you plan to use Android Studio and do not want to define this environment variable globally you can set it inside the build.gradle. \n"});
