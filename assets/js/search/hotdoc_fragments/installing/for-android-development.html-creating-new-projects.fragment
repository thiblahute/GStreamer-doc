This file describes the native files in your project and its barebones structure as auto generated by Eclipse is \nAndroid.mk \nWhere line specifies the name of the so file that will contain your native code and line states all source files that compose your native code separated by spaces. \nAdding GStreamer support only requires adding these lines \nAndroid.mk with GStreamer support \nWhere line specifies an extra library to be included in the project libgstreamer_android.so. This library contains all GStreamer code tailored for your application s needs as shown below. \nLine specifies additional system libraries in this case in order to access android specific functionality. \nLines and simply define some convenient macros. \nLine lists the plugins you want statically linked into libgstreamer_android.so. Listing only the ones you need makes your application smaller. \nLine is required to have HTTPS TLS support from GStreamer through the souphttpsrc element. \nLine defines which GStreamer libraries your application requires. \nFinally line includes the make files which perform the rest of the magic. \nListing all desired plugins can be cumbersome so they have been grouped into categories which can be used by including the plugins.mk file and used as follows \n"});
