This file is a python code which allows overriding defining some options. \nIf the file does not exist Cerbero will try to determine the distro you are running and will use default build options such as the default build directory. The default options should work fine on the supported distributions. \nAn example configuration file with detailed comments can be found here \nTo fire up the bootstrapping process go to the directory where you cloned unpacked Cerbero and type \nEnter the superuser root password when prompted. \nThe bootstrap process will then install all packages required to build GStreamer. \n"});
