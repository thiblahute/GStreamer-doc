However there is a last step remaining. \nApplications built with Visual C depend on the Visual C Runtime which is a DLL that gets installed when you install Visual Studio. If you were to distribute your application you would need to distribute this DLL with it What is known as the Visual C Redistributable Package This happens with every version of Visual Studio and the Runtime DLL is different for every version of Visual Studio. \nFurthermore GStreamer itself is built using a basic C runtime which comes in every Windows system since Windows XP and is named MSVCRT.DLL. If your application and GStreamer do not use the same C Runtime problems are bound to crop out. \nIn order to avoid these issues you must instruct your application to use the system s C Runtime. First install the Windows Device Driver Kit Version DDK When the installer asks about the features select only Build Environments Accept the suggested location for the installation which is usually C WinDDK This download is an ISO file you can either burn a DVD with it as recommended in the Microsoft site. You will need DVD burning software mount the file in a virtual DVD device you will need DVD virtualization software or unpack the file as if it was a regular compressed file you will need decompression software that understands the ISO format \nThen add the x86.props or x86_64.props for or bits property sheet found in GSTREAMER_ROOT_X86 share vs msvc to your project. This will make your application use the ubiquitous MSVCRT.DLL saving you some troubles in the future. \nIf you did not install the WinDDK to the standard path C WinDDK you will need to tell Visual Studio where it is. Unfortunately there is no automated way to do this. Once you have added the x86.props or x86_64.props to your project go to the Property Manager expand your project and its subfolders until you find the property sheet called config. Double click to edit it and select the section called User Macros in the list on the left. You should see a macro called WINDOWS_DRIVER_KIT. Double click to edit it and set its value to the root folder where you installed the DDK. This is the folder containing a file called samples.txt. \n"});
