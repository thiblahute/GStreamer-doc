We recommend using the latest version of a fast moving distribution such as Fedora Ubuntu non LTS Debian sid or OpenSuse to get a recent GStreamer release. \nAll the commands given in this section are intended to be typed in from a terminal. \nMake sure you have superuser root access rights to install GStreamer. \nRun the following command \nRun the following command \napt get install libgstreamer1.0 gstreamer1.0 plugins base gstreamer1.0 plugins good gstreamer1.0 plugins bad gstreamer1.0 plugins ugly gstreamer1.0 libav gstreamer1.0 doc gstreamer1.0 tools \nThe only other development environment that is required is the gcc compiler and a text editor. In order to compile code that requires GStreamer and uses the GStreamer core library remember to add this string to your gcc command \nIf you re using other GStreamer libraries e.g. the video library you have to add additional packages after gstreamer in the above string gstreamer video for the video library for example \nIf your application is built with the help of libtool e.g. when using automake autoconf as a build system you have to run the configure script from inside the gst sdk shell environment. \nThe source code for the tutorials can be copied and pasted from the tutorial pages into a text file but for convenience it is also available in a GIT repository in the examples tutorials subdirectory. \nThe GIT repository can be cloned with \nUsing the file name of the tutorial you are interested in basic tutorial in this example \nDepending on the GStreamer libraries you need to use you will have to add more packages to the pkg config command besides gstreamer At the bottom of each tutorial s source code you will find the command for that specific tutorial including the required libraries in the required order. When developing your own applications the GStreamer documentation will tell you what library a function belongs to. \nTo run the tutorials simply execute the desired tutorial \n"});
