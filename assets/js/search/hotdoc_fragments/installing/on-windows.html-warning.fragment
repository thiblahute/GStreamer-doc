It can be done by adding GSTREAMER_ROOT_X86 bin to the PATH environment variable or by running the application from this same folder. \nAt runtime GStreamer will look for its plugins in the following folders \nSo typically if your application can find libgstreamer dll it will find the GStreamer plugins as long as the installation folder structure is unmodified. If you do change this structure in your application then you can use the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to point GStreamer to its plugins. The plugins are initially found at GSTREAMER_ROOT_X86 lib gstreamer \nAdditionally if you want to prevent GStreamer from looking in all the default folders listed above you can set the GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH environment variable to point where the plugins are located. \n"});
