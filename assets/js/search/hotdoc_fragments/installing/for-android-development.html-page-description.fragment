You must define an environment variable called GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID and point it to the folder where you extracted the GStreamer binaries. This environment variable must be available at build time so maybe you want to make it available system wide by adding it to your profile file on Linux and Mac or to the Environment Variables in the System Properties dialog on Windows \nPoint GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID to the folder where you unzipped the binaries. \nIf you plan to use Android Studio and do not want to define this environment variable globally you can set it inside the build.gradle. \nThere are two routes to use GStreamer in an Android application Either writing your GStreamer code in Java or in C. \nAndroid applications are mainly written in Java so adding GStreamer code to them in the same language is a huge advantage. However this requires using language bindings for the GStreamer API which are not complete yet. In the meantime this documentation will use Java for the User Interface UI part and C for the GStreamer code. Both parts interact through JNI. \nBuild and run your application as explained in the Building the tutorials section. \n"});
