You will need to follow the steps detailed in this page but skipping the step Build GStreamer and installing the GStreamer s development files as explained in Installing GStreamer. \nBy default Cerbero uses as prefix a folder in the user directory with the following schema cerbero dist platform_ arch but for GStreamer we must change this prefix to use its installation directory. This can be done with a custom configuration file named custom.cbc \nThe prefix path might not be writable by your current user. Make sure you fix it before for instance with \nCerbero has a shell command that starts a new shell with all the environment set up to target GStreamer. You can start a new shell using the installation prefix defined in custom.cbc with the following command \nOnce you are in Cerbero s shell you can compile new projects targeting GStreamer using the regular build process \n"});
