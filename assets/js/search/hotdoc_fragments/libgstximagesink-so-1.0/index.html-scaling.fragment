This is accomplished by asking the peer pad if it accepts some different caps which in most cases implies that there is a scaling element in the pipeline or that an element generating the video frames can generate them with a different geometry. This mechanism is handled during buffer allocations for each allocation request the video sink will check the drawable geometry look at the force aspect ratio property calculate the geometry of desired video frames and then check that the peer pad accept those new caps. If it does it will then allocate a buffer in video memory with this new geometry and return it with the new caps. \n"});
