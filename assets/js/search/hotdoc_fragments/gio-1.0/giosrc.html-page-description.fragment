fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gio-1.0/giosrc.html#page-description", "fragment": "This plugin reads data from a local or remote location specified by an URI. This location can be specified using any protocol supported by the GIO library or it s VFS backends. Common protocols are file http ftp or smb \nIf an URI or GFile is not mounted giosrc will post a message of type GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT with name not mounted on the bus. The message also contains the GFile and the corresponding URI. Applications can use the not mounted message to mount the GFile by calling g_file_mount_enclosing_volume and then restart the pipeline after the mounting has succeeded. Note that right after the not mounted message a normal error message is posted on the bus which should be ignored if not mounted is handled by the application for example by calling gst_bus_set_flushing bus TRUE after the not mounted message was received and gst_bus_set_flushing bus FALSE after the mounting was successful. \nThe above pipeline will simply read a local file and do nothing with the data read. Instead of giosrc we could just as well have used the filesrc element here. \nThe above pipeline will copy a file from a remote host to the local file system using the Samba protocol. \nThe above pipeline will read and decode and play an mp3 file from a SAMBA server. \n"});
