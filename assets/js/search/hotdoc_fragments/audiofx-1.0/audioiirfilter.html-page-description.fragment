Before usage the a and b properties have to be set to the filter coefficients that should be used. \nThe filter coefficients describe the numerator and denominator of the transfer function. \nTo change the filter coefficients whenever the sampling rate changes the rate changed signal can be used. This should be done for most IIR filters as they re depending on the sampling rate. \n"});
