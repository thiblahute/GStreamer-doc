By default the element will try to negotiate to the same size on the source and sinkpad so that no scaling is needed. It is therefore safe to insert this element in a pipeline to get more robust behaviour without any cost if no scaling is needed. \nThis element supports a wide range of color spaces including various YUV and RGB formats and is therefore generally able to operate anywhere in a pipeline. \nDecode an Ogg Theora and display the video. If the video sink chosen cannot perform scaling the video scaling will be performed by videoscale when you resize the video window.
