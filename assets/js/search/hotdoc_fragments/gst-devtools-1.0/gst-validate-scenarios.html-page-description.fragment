The name of the scenario is the name of the file without its scenario extension. The scenario file format is based on the GstStructure serialized format which is a basic type aware key value format. It takes the type of the action in the first comma separated field and then some key value pairs in the form parameter value separated by commas. The values type will be guessed if not casted as in parameter string value. You can force the type guessing system to actually know what type you want by giving it the right hints. For example to make sure the value is a double you should add a decimal ie. will be considered as a int but will be considered as a double and will be considered as a string \nFor example to represent a seek action you should add the following line in the scenario file. \nThe files to be used as scenario should have a scenario extension and should be placed either in USER_DATA_DIR gstreamer validate scenarios GST_DATADIR gstreamer validate scenarios or in a path defined in the GST_VALIDATE_SCENARIOS_PATH environment variable. \nEach line in the scenario file represent an action you can also use at the end of a line write a single action on multiple lines Usually you should start you scenario with a description config action in order for the user to have more information about the scenario. It can contain a summary field which is a string explaining what the scenario does and then several info fields about the scenario. You can find more info about it running \nSo a basic scenario file that will seek three times and stop would look like \nMany action types have been implemented to help users define their own scenarios. For example there are \nNOTE This action actually posts a GST_MESSAGE_REQUEST_STATE message requesting GST_STATE_NULL on the bus and the application should quit. \nTo get all the details about the registered action types you can list them all with \nand to include transcoding specific action types \nMany scenarios are distributed with gst validate you can list them all using \nYou can find more information about the scenario implementation and action types in the GstValidateScenario section. \n"});
