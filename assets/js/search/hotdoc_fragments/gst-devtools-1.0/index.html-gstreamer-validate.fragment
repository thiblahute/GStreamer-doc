It was first started to provide plug ins developers with a tool to check that they use the framework the proper way. \nGstValidate implements a monitoring logic that allows the system to check that the elements of a GstPipeline respect some rules GStreamer components have to follow to make them properly interact together. For example a GstValidatePadMonitor will make sure that if we receive a GstSegment from upstream an equivalent segment is sent downstream before any buffer gets out. \nThen GstValidate implements a reporting system that allows users to get detailed informations about what was not properly handled by the elements. The generated reports are ordered by level of importance from issue to critical \nSome tools have been implemented to help developers validate and test their GstElement you can have a look at the command line tools section to find more information. \nOn top of that the notion of a validation scenario has been implemented so that developers can easily execute a set of actions on pipelines to test real world interactive cases and reproduce existing issues in a convenient way. \n"});
