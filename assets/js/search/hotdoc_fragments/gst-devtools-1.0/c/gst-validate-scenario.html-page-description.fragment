This method should be called to retrieved and compute a timed value of a given action. It will first try to retrieve the value as a double then get it as a string and execute any formula taking into account the position and duration variables. And it will always convert that value to a GstClockTime. \nPrints the action types details wanted in wanted_types \nRegister a new action type to the action type system.
