It was first\nstarted to provide plug-ins developers with a tool to check that they\nuse the framework the proper way.</p>\n<p>GstValidate implements a monitoring logic that allows the system to\ncheck that the elements of a GstPipeline respect some rules GStreamer\ncomponents have to follow to make them properly interact together. For\nexample, a GstValidatePadMonitor will make sure that if we receive a\nGstSegment from upstream, an equivalent segment is sent downstream\nbefore any buffer gets out.</p>\n<p>Then GstValidate implements a reporting system that allows users to get\ndetailed informations about what was not properly handled by the\nelements. The generated reports are ordered by level of importance from\n\"issue\" to \"critical\".</p>\n<p>Some tools have been implemented to help developers validate and test\ntheir GstElement, you can have a look at the <a href=\"command-line-tools.md\">command line tools\nsection</a> to find more information.</p>\n<p>On top of that, the notion of a [validation scenario] has been\nimplemented so that developers can easily execute a set of actions on\npipelines to test real world interactive cases and reproduce existing\nissues in a convenient way.</p>\n\n        \n\n    </div>\n\n\n        "});
