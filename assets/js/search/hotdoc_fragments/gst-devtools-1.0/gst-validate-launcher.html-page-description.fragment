Those media samples are stored with git annex so you will need it to be able to launch the default testsuite. \nThe first time you launch the testsuite you will need to make sure that the media samples are downloaded. To do so and launch the testsuite you can simply do \nThis will only launch the GstValidate tests and not other applications that might be supported currently ges launch is also supported and has its own default testsuite \nLaunching the default testsuite will open close many windows you might want to mute it so you can keep using your computer \nTo implement a testsuite you will have to write some simple python code that defines the tests to be launched by gst validate launcher. \nIn this example we will assume that you want to write a whole new testsuite based on your own media samples and scenarios. The set of media files and the testsuite implementation file will be structured as follow \nYou should generate the media_info files. To generate them for local files you can use \nFor remote streams you should use gst validate media check GST_API_VERSION. For an http stream you can for example do \nThe gst validate launcher will use the generated media_info and stream_info files to validate the tests as those contain the necessary information. \nThen you will need to write the testsuite.py file. You can for example implement the following testsuite \nOnce this is done you ve got a testsuite that will \nRun playbin pipelines on file.mp4 file1.mkv and file2.ogv gt executing scenario and scenario1 scenarios \nTranscode file.mp4 file1.mkv and file2.ogv to Theora and Vorbis in a OGG container \nThe only thing to do to run the testsuite is \nYou can find detailed information about the launcher by launching it \n"});
