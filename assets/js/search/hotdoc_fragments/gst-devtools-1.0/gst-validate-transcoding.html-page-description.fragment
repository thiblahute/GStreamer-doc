It corresponds to the restriction GstCaps to apply before the encoder that will be used in the profile. The fields present in restriction caps are properties of the raw stream that is before encoding such as height and width for video and depth and sampling rate for audio. This property does not make sense for muxers. \nTo force a video stream to be encoded with a Full HD resolution using WebM as the container format VP8 as the video codec and Vorbis as the audio codec you should use \nMP3 audio and H264 in MP4 \nVorbis and theora in OGG \nAC3 and H264 in MPEG TS \ngst validate transcoding takes and input URI and an output URI plus a few options to control how transcoding should be tested. \n"});
