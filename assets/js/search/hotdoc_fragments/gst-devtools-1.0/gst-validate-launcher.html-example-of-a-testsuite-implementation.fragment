The set of media files and the testsuite implementation file will be structured as follow \nYou should generate the media_info files. To generate them for local files you can use \nFor remote streams you should use gst validate media check GST_API_VERSION. For an http stream you can for example do \nThe gst validate launcher will use the generated media_info and stream_info files to validate the tests as those contain the necessary information. \nThen you will need to write the testsuite.py file. You can for example implement the following testsuite \nOnce this is done you ve got a testsuite that will \nRun playbin pipelines on file.mp4 file1.mkv and file2.ogv gt executing scenario and scenario1 scenarios \nTranscode file.mp4 file1.mkv and file2.ogv to Theora and Vorbis in a OGG container \nThe only thing to do to run the testsuite is \n"});
