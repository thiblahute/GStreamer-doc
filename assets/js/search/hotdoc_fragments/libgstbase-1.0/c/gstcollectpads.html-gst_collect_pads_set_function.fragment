However if circumstances are more complicated and or more control is desired this sets a callback that will be invoked instead when all the pads added to the collection have buffers queued. Evidently this callback is not compatible with gst_collect_pads_set_buffer_function callback. If this callback is set the former will be unset. \nMT safe. \nParameters \nthe collectpads to use \nthe function to set \nuser data passed to the function \n"});
