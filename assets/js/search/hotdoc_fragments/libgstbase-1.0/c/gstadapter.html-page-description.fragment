All four bytes of the pattern must be present in the adapter for it to match even if the first or last bytes are masked out. \nIt is an error to call this function without making sure that there is enough data offset size bytes in the adapter. \nThis function calls gst_adapter_masked_scan_uint32_peek passing NULL for value. \nScan for pattern pattern with applied mask mask in the adapter data starting from offset offset. If a match is found the value that matched is returned through value otherwise value is left untouched. \nThe bytes in pattern and mask are interpreted left to right regardless of endianness. All four bytes of the pattern must be present in the adapter for it to match even if the first or last bytes are masked out. \nIt is an error to call this function without making sure that there is enough data offset size bytes in the adapter. \nGet the offset that was on the last buffer with the GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DISCONT flag or GST_BUFFER_OFFSET_NONE. \nGet the dts that was before the byte at offset offset in the adapter. When distance is given the amount of bytes between the dts and the current position is returned. \nThe dts is reset to GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE and the distance is set to when the adapter is first created or when it is cleared. This also means that before the first byte with a dts is removed from the adapter the dts and distance returned are GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE and respectively. \nGet the pts that was before the byte at offset offset in the adapter. When distance is given the amount of bytes between the pts and the current position is returned. \nThe pts is reset to GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE and the distance is set to when the adapter is first created or when it is cleared. This also means that before the first byte with a pts is removed from the adapter the pts and distance returned are GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE and respectively. \n"});
