This version of the running time DTS can be negative. G_MININT64 is used to indicate invalid value. \nDefault GstCollectPads event handling that elements should always chain up to to ensure proper operation. Element might however indicate event should not be forwarded downstream. \nDefault GstCollectPads query handling that elements should always chain up to to ensure proper operation. Element might however indicate query should not be forwarded downstream. \nSet the callback function and user data that will be called with the oldest buffer when all pads have been collected or NULL on EOS. If a buffer is passed the callback owns a reference and must unref it. \nMT safe. \nInstall a clipping function that is called right after a buffer is received on a pad managed by pads. See GstCollectPadsClipFunction for more info. \nSet the timestamp comparison function. \nMT safe. \nSet the event callback function and user data that will be called when collectpads has received an event originating from one of the collected pads. If the event being processed is a serialized one this callback is called with pads STREAM_LOCK held otherwise not. As this lock should be held when calling a number of CollectPads functions it should be acquired if so unusually needed. \nMT safe. \nInstall a flush function that is called when the internal state of all pads should be flushed as part of flushing seek handling. See GstCollectPadsFlushFunction for more info. \nChange the flushing state of all the pads in the collection. No pad is able to accept anymore data when flushing is TRUE. Calling this function with flushing FALSE makes pads accept data again. Caller must ensure that downstream streaming thread is not blocked e.g. by sending a FLUSH_START downstream. \nMT safe. \nCollectPads provides a default collection algorithm that will determine the oldest buffer available on all of its pads and then delegate to a configured callback. However if circumstances are more complicated and or more control is desired this sets a callback that will be invoked instead when all the pads added to the collection have buffers queued. Evidently this callback is not compatible with gst_collect_pads_set_buffer_function callback. If this callback is set the former will be unset. \nMT safe. \nSet the query callback function and user data that will be called after collectpads has received a query originating from one of the collected pads. If the query being processed is a serialized one this callback is called with pads STREAM_LOCK held otherwise not. As this lock should be held when calling a number of CollectPads functions it should be acquired if so unusually needed. \nMT safe. \nDefault GstCollectPads event handling for the src pad of elements. Elements can chain up to this to let flushing seek event handling be done by GstCollectPads. \ngpointer _gst_reserved \nGet the stream lock of pads. The stream lock is used to coordinate and serialize execution among the various streams being collected and in protecting the resources used to accomplish this. \nUnlock the stream lock of pads. \nSet if collectdata s pad is flushing. \nGST_COLLECT_PADS_STATE_NEW_SEGMENT \nSet if collectdata s pad received a new_segment event. \nGST_COLLECT_PADS_STATE_WAITING \nSet if collectdata s pad must be waited for when collecting. \nGST_COLLECT_PADS_STATE_LOCKED \n"});
