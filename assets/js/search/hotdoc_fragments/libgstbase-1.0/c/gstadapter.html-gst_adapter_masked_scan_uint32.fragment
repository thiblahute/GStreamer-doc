All four bytes of the pattern must be present in the adapter for it to match even if the first or last bytes are masked out. \nIt is an error to call this function without making sure that there is enough data offset size bytes in the adapter. \nThis function calls gst_adapter_masked_scan_uint32_peek passing NULL for value. \nParameters \na GstAdapter \nmask to apply to data before matching against pattern \npattern to match after mask is applied \noffset into the adapter data from which to start scanning returns the last scanned position. \nnumber of bytes to scan from offset \noffset of the first match or if no match was found. \nExample \n"});
