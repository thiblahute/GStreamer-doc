The latency will be queried from the upstream elements. live will be TRUE if sink is configured to synchronize against the clock. upstream_live will be TRUE if an upstream element is live. \nIf both live and upstream_live are TRUE the sink will want to compensate for the latency introduced by the upstream elements by setting the min_latency to a strictly positive value. \nThis function is mostly used by subclasses. \nParameters \nthe sink \nif the sink is live \nif an upstream element is live \nthe min latency of the upstream elements \nthe max latency of the upstream elements \nTRUE if the query succeeded. \n"});
