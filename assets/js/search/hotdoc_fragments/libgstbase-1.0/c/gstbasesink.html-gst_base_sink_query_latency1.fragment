The latency will be queried from the upstream elements. live will be TRUE if sink is configured to synchronize against the clock. upstream_live will be TRUE if an upstream element is live. \nIf both live and upstream_live are TRUE the sink will want to compensate for the latency introduced by the upstream elements by setting the min_latency to a strictly positive value. \nThis function is mostly used by subclasses. \nsink \nthe sink \nlive \nif the sink is live \nupstream_live \nif an upstream element is live \nmin_latency \nthe min latency of the upstream elements \nmax_latency \nthe max latency of the upstream elements \n\nTRUE if the query succeeded. \n"});
