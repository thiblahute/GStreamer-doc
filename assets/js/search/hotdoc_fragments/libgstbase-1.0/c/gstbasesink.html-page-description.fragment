This property can be used to generate thumbnails. \nThe GstCaps on the sample can be used to determine the type of the buffer. \nFree function gst_sample_unref \nGet the maximum amount of bits per second that the sink will render. \nGets the max lateness value. See gst_base_sink_set_max_lateness for more details. \nGet the render delay of sink. see gst_base_sink_set_render_delay for more information about the render delay. \nGet the time that will be inserted between frames to control the maximum buffers per second. \nChecks if sink is currently configured to perform asynchronous state changes to PAUSED. \nChecks if sink is currently configured to store the last received sample in the last sample property. \nConfigures sink to perform all state changes asynchronously. When async is disabled the sink will immediately go to PAUSED instead of waiting for a preroll buffer. This feature is useful if the sink does not synchronize against the clock or when it is dealing with sparse streams. \nConfigure sink to drop buffers which are outside the current segment \nConfigures sink to store the last received sample in the last sample property. \nSet the maximum amount of bits per second that the sink will render. \nSets the new max lateness value to max_lateness. This value is used to decide if a buffer should be dropped or not based on the buffer timestamp and the current clock time. A value of means an unlimited time. \nConfigures sink to send Quality of Service events upstream. \nSet the render delay in sink to delay. The render delay is the time between actual rendering of a buffer and its synchronisation time. Some devices might delay media rendering which can be compensated for with this function. \nAfter calling this function this sink will report additional latency and other sinks will adjust their latency to delay the rendering of their media. \nThis function is usually called by subclasses. \nSet the time that will be inserted between rendered buffers. This can be used to control the maximum buffers per second that the sink will render. \n"});
