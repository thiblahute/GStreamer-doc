The pads need to be named sink and src It also needs to set the fixed caps on srcpad when the format is ensured e.g. when base class calls subclass set_sink_caps function \nThis base class uses GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT as a meaning of frames. So subclass conversion routine needs to know that conversion from GST_FORMAT_TIME to GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT must return the frame number that can be found from the given byte position. \nGstBaseParse uses subclasses conversion methods also for seeking or otherwise uses its own default one see also below \nSubclass start and stop functions will be called to inform the beginning and end of data processing. \nThings that subclass need to take care of \nProvide pad templates \nFixate the source pad caps when appropriate \nInform base class how big data chunks should be retrieved. This is done with gst_base_parse_set_min_frame_size function. \nExamine data chunks passed to subclass with handle_frame and pass proper frame s to gst_base_parse_finish_frame and setting src pad caps and timestamps on frame. \nProvide conversion functions \nUpdate the duration information with gst_base_parse_set_duration \nOptionally passthrough using gst_base_parse_set_passthrough \nConfigure various baseparse parameters using gst_base_parse_set_average_bitrate gst_base_parse_set_syncable and gst_base_parse_set_frame_rate. \nIn particular if subclass is unable to determine a duration but parsing or specs yields a frames per seconds rate then this can be provided to GstBaseParse to enable it to cater for buffer time metadata which will be taken from upstream as much as possible Internally keeping track of frame durations and respective sizes that have been pushed provides GstBaseParse with an estimated bitrate. A default convert used if not overridden will then use these rates to perform obvious conversions. These rates are also used to update estimated duration at regular frame intervals. \n"});
