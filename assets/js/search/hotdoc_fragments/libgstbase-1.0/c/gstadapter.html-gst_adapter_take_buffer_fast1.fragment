The returned bytes will be flushed from the adapter. This function is potentially more performant than gst_adapter_take_buffer since it can reuse the memory in pushed buffers by subbuffering or merging. Unlike gst_adapter_take_buffer the returned buffer may be composed of multiple non contiguous GstMemory objects no copies are made. \nNote that no assumptions should be made as to whether certain buffer flags such as the DISCONT flag are set on the returned buffer or not. The caller needs to explicitly set or unset flags that should be set or unset. \nThis will also copy over all GstMeta of the input buffers except for meta with the GST_META_FLAG_POOLED flag or with the memory tag. \nThis function can return buffer up to the return value of gst_adapter_available without making copies if possible. \nCaller owns a reference to the returned buffer. gst_buffer_unref after usage. \nFree function gst_buffer_unref \nadapter \na GstAdapter \nnbytes \nthe number of bytes to take \n\na GstBuffer containing the first nbytes of the adapter or NULL if nbytes bytes are not available. gst_buffer_unref when no longer needed. \nSince \n"});
