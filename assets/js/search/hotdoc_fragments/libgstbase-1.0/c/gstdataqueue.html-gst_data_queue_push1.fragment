fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstbase-1.0/c/gstdataqueue.html#gst_data_queue_push1", "fragment": "gst_data_queue_push \nPushes a GstDataQueueItem or a structure that begins with the same fields on the queue. If the queue is full the call will block until space is available OR the queue is set to flushing state. MT safe. \nNote that this function has slightly different semantics than gst_pad_push and gst_pad_push_event this function only takes ownership of item and the GstMiniObject contained in item if the push was successful. If FALSE is returned the caller is responsible for freeing item and its contents. \n"});
