It is usually called by subclasses that use their own internal synchronisation. \nIf time is not valid no synchronisation is done and GST_CLOCK_BADTIME is returned. Likewise if synchronisation is disabled in the element or there is no clock no synchronisation is done and GST_CLOCK_BADTIME is returned. \nThis function should only be called with the PREROLL_LOCK held like when receiving an EOS event in the GstBaseSink.event vmethod or when receiving a buffer in the GstBaseSink.render vmethod. \nThe time argument should be the running_time of when this method should return and is not adjusted with any latency or offset configured in the sink. \nParameters \nthe sink \nthe running_time to be reached \nthe jitter to be filled with time diff or NULL \nGstClockReturn \n"});
