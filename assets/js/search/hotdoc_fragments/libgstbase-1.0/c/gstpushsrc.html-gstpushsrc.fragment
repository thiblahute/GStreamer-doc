The source usually prefers to push out a fixed size buffer. \nSubclasses usually operate in a format that is different from the default GST_FORMAT_BYTES format of GstBaseSrc. \nClasses extending this base class will usually be scheduled in a push based mode. If the peer accepts to operate without offsets and within the limits of the allowed block size this class can operate in getrange based mode automatically. To make this possible the subclass should implement and override the SCHEDULING query. \nThe subclass should extend the methods from the baseclass in addition to the create method. \nSeeking flushing scheduling and sync is all handled by this base class. \n"});
