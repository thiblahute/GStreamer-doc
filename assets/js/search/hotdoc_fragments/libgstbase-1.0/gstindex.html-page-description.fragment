fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstbase-1.0/gstindex.html#page-description", "fragment": "GstIndex is used to generate a stream index of one or more elements in a pipeline. \nElements will overload the set_index and get_index virtual methods in GstElement. When streaming data the element will add index entries if it has an index set. \nEach element that adds to the index will do that using a writer_id. The writer_id is obtained from gst_index_get_writer_id. \nThe application that wants to index the stream will create a new index object using gst_index_new or gst_index_factory_make. The index is assigned to a specific element a bin or the whole pipeline. This will cause indexable elements to add entires to the index while playing. \n"});
