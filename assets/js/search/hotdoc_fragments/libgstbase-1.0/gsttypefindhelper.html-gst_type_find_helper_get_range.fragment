Unlike prototype.type_find_helper however this function will use the specified function func to obtain the data needed by the typefind functions rather than operating on a given source pad. This is useful mostly for elements like tag demuxers which strip off data at the beginning and or end of a file and want to typefind the stripped data stream before adding their own source pad the specified callback can then call the upstream peer pad with offsets adjusted for the tag size for example \nWhen extension is not null this function will first try the typefind functions for the given extension which might speed up the typefinding in many cases. \nFree function gst_caps_unref \nParameters \nA Gst.Object that will be passed as first argument to func \nthe parent of obj or null \nA generic GstBase.TypeFindHelperGetRangeFunction that will be used to access data at random offsets when doing the typefinding \nThe length in bytes \nextension of the media \nReturns a tuple made of \nthe Gst.Caps corresponding to the data stream.
