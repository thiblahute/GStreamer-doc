In this case the subclass must be prepared to continue rendering where it left off if this function returns Gst.FlowReturn.prototype.ok. \nThis function will block until a state change to PLAYING happens in which case this function returns Gst.FlowReturn.prototype.ok or the processing must be stopped due to a state change to READY or a FLUSH event in which case this function returns Gst.FlowReturn.prototype.flushing \nThis function should only be called with the PREROLL_LOCK held like in the render function. \n"});
