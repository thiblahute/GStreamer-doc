When the subclass returns GST_FLOW_OK it MUST return a buffer of the requested size unless fewer bytes are available because an EOS condition is near. No buffer should be returned when the return value is different from GST_FLOW_OK. A return value of GST_FLOW_EOS signifies that the end of stream is reached. The default implementation will call GstBaseSrcClass.alloc and then call GstBaseSrcClass.fill \n"});
