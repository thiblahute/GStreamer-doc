As it is not counted as a frame bitrate increases but frame to time conversions are maintained. \nGstBase.BaseParseFrameFlags.prototype.clip \npre_push_frame can set this to indicate that regular segment clipping can still be performed as opposed to any custom one having been done \nGstBase.BaseParseFrameFlags.prototype.drop \nindicates to finish_frame that the the frame should be dropped and might be handled internally by subclass \nGstBase.BaseParseFrameFlags.prototype.queue \nindicates to finish_frame that the the frame should be queued for now and processed fully later when the first non queued frame is finished \n"});
