The source usually\nprefers to push out a fixed size buffer.</p>\n<p>Subclasses usually operate in a format that is different from the\ndefault GST_FORMAT_BYTES format of <a href=\"gstbasesrc.html#GstBaseSrc\">GstBase.BaseSrc</a>.</p>\n<p>Classes extending this base class will usually be scheduled\nin a push based mode. If the peer accepts to operate without\noffsets and within the limits of the allowed block size, this\nclass can operate in getrange based mode automatically. To make\nthis possible, the subclass should implement and override the\nSCHEDULING query.</p>\n<p>The subclass should extend the methods from the baseclass in\naddition to the ::create method.</p>\n<p>Seeking, flushing, scheduling and sync is all handled by this\nbase class.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n"});
