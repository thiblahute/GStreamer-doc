The latency will be queried from the upstream elements. live will be true if sink is configured to synchronize against the clock. upstream_live will be true if an upstream element is live. \nIf both live and upstream_live are true the sink will want to compensate for the latency introduced by the upstream elements by setting the min_latency to a strictly positive value. \nThis function is mostly used by subclasses. \nParameters \nthe sink \nReturns a tuple made of \ntrue if the query succeeded. \ntrue if the query succeeded. \ntrue if the query succeeded. \ntrue if the query succeeded. \ntrue if the query succeeded. \n"});
