The application would then wait for an EOS message posted on the pipeline s bus to know when all data has been processed and the pipeline can safely be stopped. \nAn application may send an EOS event to a source element to make it perform the EOS logic send EOS event downstream or post a Gst.MessageType.prototype.segment_done on the bus This can typically be done with the Gst.Element.prototype.send_event function on the element or its parent bin. \nAfter the EOS has been sent to the element the application should wait for an EOS message to be posted on the pipeline s bus. Once this EOS message is received it may safely shut down the entire pipeline. \n"});
