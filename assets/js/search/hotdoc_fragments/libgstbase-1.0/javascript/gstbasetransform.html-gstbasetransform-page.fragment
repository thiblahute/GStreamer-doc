Elements that are suitable for implementation using GstBase.BaseTransform are ones where the size and caps of the output is known entirely from the input caps and buffer sizes. These include elements that directly transform one buffer into another modify the contents of a buffer in place as well as elements that collate multiple input buffers into one output buffer or that expand one input buffer into multiple output buffers. See below for more concrete use cases. \nIt provides for \none sinkpad and one srcpad \nPossible formats on sink and source pad implemented with custom transform_caps function. By default uses same format on sink and source. \nHandles state changes \nDoes flushing \nPush mode \nPull mode if the sub class transform can operate on arbitrary data \n"});
