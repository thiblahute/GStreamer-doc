This function is endianness agnostic you should not assume the UTF characters are in host endianness. \nThis function will fail if no NUL terminator was found in in the data. \nNote there is no peek or get variant of this function to ensure correct byte alignment of the UTF string. \nParameters \na GstBase.ByteReader instance \nReturns a tuple made of \ntrue if a string could be read false otherwise. The string put into str must be freed with GLib.prototype.free when no longer needed. \ntrue if a string could be read false otherwise. The string put into str must be freed with GLib.prototype.free when no longer needed. \n"});
