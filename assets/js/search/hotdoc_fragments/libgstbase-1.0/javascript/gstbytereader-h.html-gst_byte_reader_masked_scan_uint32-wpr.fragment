All four bytes of the pattern must be present in the byte reader data for it to match even if the first or last bytes are masked out. \nIt is an error to call this function without making sure that there is enough data offset size bytes in the byte reader. \nParameters \na GstBase.ByteReader \nmask to apply to data before matching against pattern \npattern to match after mask is applied \noffset from which to start scanning relative to the current position \nnumber of bytes to scan from offset \noffset of the first match or if no match was found. \nExample \n"});
