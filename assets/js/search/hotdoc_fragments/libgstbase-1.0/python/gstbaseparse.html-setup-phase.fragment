Subclass could already set the srcpad caps accordingly but this might be delayed until calling GstBase.BaseParse.finish_frame with a non queued frame. \nAt least at this point subclass needs to tell the GstBase.BaseParse class how big data chunks it wants to receive min_frame_size It can do this with GstBase.BaseParse.set_min_frame_size. \nGstBase.BaseParse class sets up appropriate data passing mode pull push and starts to process the data. \n"});
