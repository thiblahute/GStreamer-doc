It is usually called by subclasses that use their own internal synchronisation. \nIf time is not valid no synchronisation is done and Gst.ClockReturn.badtime is returned. Likewise if synchronisation is disabled in the element or there is no clock no synchronisation is done and Gst.ClockReturn.badtime is returned. \nThis function should only be called with the PREROLL_LOCK held like when receiving an EOS event in the event vmethod or when receiving a buffer in the render vmethod. \nThe time argument should be the running_time of when this method should return and is not adjusted with any latency or offset configured in the sink. \nParameters \nthe sink \nthe running_time to be reached \nReturns a tuple made of \nGst.ClockReturn \nGst.ClockReturn \n"});
