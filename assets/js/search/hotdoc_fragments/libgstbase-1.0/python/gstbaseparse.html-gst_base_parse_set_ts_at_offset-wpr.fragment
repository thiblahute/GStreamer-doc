In certain cases the correct timestamps will occur in the stream after the start of the frame but before the start of the actual picture data. This function can be used to set the timestamps based on the offset into the frame data that the picture starts. \nParameters \na GstBase.BaseParse \noffset into current buffer \nSince \n"});
