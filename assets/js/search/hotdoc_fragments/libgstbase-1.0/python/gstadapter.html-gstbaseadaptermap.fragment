The returned pointer is valid until the next function is called on the adapter. \nNote that setting the returned pointer as the data of a Gst.Buffer is incorrect for general purpose plugins. The reason is that if a downstream element stores the buffer so that it has access to it outside of the bounds of its chain function the buffer will have an invalid data pointer after your element flushes the bytes. In that case you should use GstBase.Adapter.take which returns a freshly allocated buffer that you can set as Gst.Buffer memory or the potentially more performant GstBase.Adapter.take_buffer. \nReturns None if size bytes are not available. \nadapter \na GstBase.Adapter \n\ntransfer none array length size element type guint8 nullable a pointer to the first size bytes of data or None \nsize \ntransfer none array length size element type guint8 nullable a pointer to the first size bytes of data or None \n"});
