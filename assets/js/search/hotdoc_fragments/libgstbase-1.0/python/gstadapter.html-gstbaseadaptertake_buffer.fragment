fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstbase-1.0/python/gstadapter.html#gstbaseadaptertake_buffer", "fragment": "GstBase.Adapter.take_buffer \nReturns a Gst.Buffer containing the first nbytes bytes of the adapter. The returned bytes will be flushed from the adapter. This function is potentially more performant than GstBase.Adapter.take since it can reuse the memory in pushed buffers by subbuffering or merging. This function will always return a buffer with a single memory region. \nNote that no assumptions should be made as to whether certain buffer flags such as the DISCONT flag are set on the returned buffer or not. The caller needs to explicitly set or unset flags that should be set or unset. \nSince this will also copy over all GstMeta of the input buffers except for meta with the Gst.MetaFlags.pooled flag or with the memory tag. \nCaller owns a reference to the returned buffer. gst_buffer_unref not introspectable after usage. \nFree function gst_buffer_unref \n"});
