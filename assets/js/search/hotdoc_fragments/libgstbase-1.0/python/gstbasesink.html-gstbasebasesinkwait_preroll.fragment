In this case the subclass must be prepared to continue rendering where it left off if this function returns Gst.FlowReturn.ok. \nThis function will block until a state change to PLAYING happens in which case this function returns Gst.FlowReturn.ok or the processing must be stopped due to a state change to READY or a FLUSH event in which case this function returns Gst.FlowReturn.flushing \nThis function should only be called with the PREROLL_LOCK held like in the render function. \nParameters \nthe sink \nGst.FlowReturn.ok if the preroll completed and processing can continue. Any other return value should be returned from the render vmethod. \n"});
