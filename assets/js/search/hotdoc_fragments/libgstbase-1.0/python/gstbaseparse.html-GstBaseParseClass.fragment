Allows opening external resources. \nGstBaseParseClass.handle_frame \nParses the input data into valid frames as defined by subclass which should be passed to GstBase.BaseParse.finish_frame. The frame s input buffer is guaranteed writable whereas the input frame ownership is held by caller so subclass should make a copy if it needs to hang on Input buffer data is provided by baseclass with as much metadata set as possible by baseclass according to upstream information and or subclass settings though subclass may still set buffer timestamp and duration if desired. \nGstBaseParseClass.pre_push_frame \nOptional. Called just prior to pushing a frame after any pending events have been sent to give subclass a chance to perform additional actions at this time e.g. tag sending or to decide whether this buffer should be dropped or not e.g. custom segment clipping \nGstBaseParseClass.convert \nOptional. Convert between formats. \nGstBaseParseClass.detect \nOptional. Called until it doesn t return GST_FLOW_OK anymore for the first buffers. Can be used by the subclass to detect the stream format. \n"});
