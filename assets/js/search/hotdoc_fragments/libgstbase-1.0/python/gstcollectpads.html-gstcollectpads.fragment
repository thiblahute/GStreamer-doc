This means that control is given to the manager of this object when all pads have data. \nCollectpads are created with GstBase.CollectPads.new. A callback should then be installed with gst_collect_pads_set_function \nPads are added to the collection with GstBase.CollectPads.add_pad GstBase.CollectPads.remove_pad. The pad has to be a sinkpad. The chain and event functions of the pad are overridden. The element_private of the pad is used to store private information for the collectpads. \nFor each pad data is queued in the _chain function or by performing a pull_range. \nWhen data is queued on all pads in waiting mode the callback function is called. \nData can be dequeued from the pad with the GstBase.CollectPads.pop method. One can peek at the data with the GstBase.CollectPads.peek function. These functions will return NULL if the pad received an EOS event. When all pads return NULL from a GstBase.CollectPads.peek the element can emit an EOS event itself. \nData can also be dequeued in byte units using the GstBase.CollectPads.available GstBase.CollectPads.read_buffer and GstBase.CollectPads.flush calls. \nElements should call GstBase.CollectPads.start and GstBase.CollectPads.stop in their state change functions to start and stop the processing of the collectpads. The GstBase.CollectPads.stop call should be called before calling the parent element state change function in the PAUSED_TO_READY state change to ensure no pad is blocked and the element can finish streaming. \nGstBase.CollectPads.set_waiting sets a pad to waiting or non waiting mode. CollectPads element is not waiting for data to be collected on non waiting pads. Thus these pads may but need not have data when the callback is called. All pads are in waiting mode by default. \n"});
