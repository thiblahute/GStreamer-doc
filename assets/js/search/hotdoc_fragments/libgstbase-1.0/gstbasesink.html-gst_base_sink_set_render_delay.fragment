The render delay is the time between actual rendering of a buffer and its synchronisation time. Some devices might delay media rendering which can be compensated for with this function. \nAfter calling this function this sink will report additional latency and other sinks will adjust their latency to delay the rendering of their media. \nThis function is usually called by subclasses. \nParameters \na GstBaseSink \nthe new delay \nSet the render delay in sink to delay.
