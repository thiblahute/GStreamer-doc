This can be either static text or text from buffers received on the text sink pad e.g. as produced by the subparse element. If the text sink pad is not linked the text set via the text property will be rendered. If the text sink pad is linked text will be rendered as it is received on that pad honouring and matching the buffer timestamps of both input streams. \nThe text can contain newline characters and text wrapping is enabled by default. \n"});
