For each of the requested sink pads it will compare the incoming geometry and framerate to define the output parameters. Indeed output video frames will have the geometry of the biggest incoming video stream and the framerate of the fastest incoming one. \nCompositor will do colorspace conversion. \nIndividual parameters for each input stream can be configured on the GstCompositorPad \nA pipeline to demonstrate compositor used together with videobox. This should show a x240 pixels video test source with some transparency showing the background checker pattern. Another video test source with just the snow pattern of x100 pixels is overlaid on top of the first one on the left vertically centered with a small transparency showing the first video test source behind and the checker pattern under it. Note that the framerate of the output video is frames per second. \nA pipeline to demostrate bgra comping. This does not demonstrate alpha blending \nA pipeline to test I420 \nA pipeline to demonstrate synchronized compositing the second stream starts after seconds \n"});
