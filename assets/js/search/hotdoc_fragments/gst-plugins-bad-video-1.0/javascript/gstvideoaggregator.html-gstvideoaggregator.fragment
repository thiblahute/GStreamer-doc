For each of the requested sink pads it will compare the incoming geometry and framerate to define the output parameters. Indeed output video frames will have the geometry of the biggest incoming video stream and the framerate of the fastest incoming one. \nVideoAggregator will do colorspace conversion. \nZorder for each input stream can be configured on the GstBadVideo.VideoAggregatorPad. \n"});
