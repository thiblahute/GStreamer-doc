If timeout contains a valid timeout this function will return GstRtsp.RTSPResult.etimeout after the timeout expired. \nThe typically use of this function is when gst_rtsp_watch_write_data returns GstRtsp.RTSPResult.enomem. The caller then calls this function to wait for free space in the backlog queue and try again. \n"});
