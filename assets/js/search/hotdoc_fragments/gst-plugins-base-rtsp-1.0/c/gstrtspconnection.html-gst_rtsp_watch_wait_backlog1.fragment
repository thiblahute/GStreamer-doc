If timeout contains a valid timeout this function will return GST_RTSP_ETIMEOUT after the timeout expired. \nThe typically use of this function is when gst_rtsp_watch_write_data returns GST_RTSP_ENOMEM. The caller then calls this function to wait for free space in the backlog queue and try again. \n"});
