This media type is typically used to generate Gst.Caps events. \nInitialize transport so that it can be used. \nConverts the range in place between different types of units. Ranges containing the special value GstRtsp.RTSPTimeType.prototype.now can not be converted as these are only valid for GstRtsp.RTSPRangeUnit.prototype.npt. \nFree the memory allocated by range. \nRetrieve the minimum and maximum values from range converted to Gst.ClockTime in min and max. \nA value of Gst.CLOCK_TIME_NONE will be used to signal GstRtsp.RTSPTimeType.prototype.now and GstRtsp.RTSPTimeType.prototype.end for min and max respectively. \nUTC times will be converted to nanoseconds since \nParse rangestr to a GstRtsp.RTSPTimeRange. \nConvert range into a string representation. \nGet the Gst.Element that can handle the buffers transported over trans. \nIt is possible that there are several managers available use option to selected one. \nmanager will contain an element name or null when no manager is needed available for trans. \nGet the mime type of the transport mode trans. This mime type is typically used to generate Gst.Caps events. \nAllocate a new initialized GstRtsp.RTSPTransport. Use GstRtsp.RTSPTransport.prototype.free after usage. \nParse the RTSP transport string str into transport. \ngchar destination \nthe destination ip hostname \nstream data over UDP multicast \nGstRtsp.RTSPLowerTrans.prototype.tcp \n"});
