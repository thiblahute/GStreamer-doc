For example a string foo fbar will decode to foo bar the f being replaced by the corresponding byte with hex value x2f. Note that there is no guarantee that the resulting byte sequence is valid in any given encoding. As a special case is not unescaped to NUL as that would prematurely terminate the string. \nAlso note that since paths usually start with a slash the first component will usually be the empty string. \n"});
