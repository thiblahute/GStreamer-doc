The Hamming window provides a faster rolloff but a bit worse stopband attenuation the other way around for the Blackman window. \nThis element has the advantage over the Chebyshev lowpass and highpass filter that it has a much better rolloff when using a larger kernel size and almost linear phase. The only disadvantage is the much slower execution time with larger kernels. \n"});
