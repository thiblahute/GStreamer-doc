Before usage the kernel property has to be set to the filter kernel that should be used and the latency property has to be set to the latency in samples that is introduced by the filter kernel. Setting a latency of n samples will lead to the first n samples being dropped from the output and n samples added to the end. \nThe filter kernel describes the impulse response of the filter. To calculate the frequency response of the filter you have to calculate the Fourier Transform of the impulse response. \nTo change the filter kernel whenever the sampling rate changes the rate changed signal can be used. This should be done for most FIR filters as they re depending on the sampling rate. \n"});
