Any attempt to push\nmore buffers into the queue will block the pushing thread until more space\nbecomes available.</p>\n<p>The queue will create a new thread on the source pad to decouple the\nprocessing on sink and source pad.</p>\n<p>You can query how many buffers are queued by reading the\n<a href=\"element-queue.html#GstQueue:current-level-buffers\">current-level-buffers</a> property. You can track changes\nby connecting to the notify::current-level-buffers signal (which\nlike all signals will be emitted from the streaming thread). The same\napplies to the <a href=\"element-queue.html#GstQueue:current-level-time\">current-level-time</a> and\n<a href=\"element-queue.html#GstQueue:current-level-bytes\">current-level-bytes</a> properties.</p>\n<p>The default queue size limits are 200 buffers, 10MB of data, or\none second worth of data, whichever is reached first.</p>\n<p>As said earlier, the queue blocks by default when one of the specified\nmaximums (bytes, time, buffers) has been reached. You can set the\n<a href=\"element-queue.html#GstQueue:leaky\">leaky</a> property to specify that instead of blocking it should\nleak (drop) new or old buffers.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-plugins/html/gstreamer-plugins-queue.html#GstQueue-underrun\">GstQueue::underrun</a> signal is emitted when the queue has less data than\nthe specified minimum thresholds require (by default: when the queue is\nempty). The <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-plugins/html/gstreamer-plugins-queue.html#GstQueue-overrun\">GstQueue::overrun</a> signal is emitted when the queue is filled\nup. Both signals are emitted from the context of the streaming thread.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
