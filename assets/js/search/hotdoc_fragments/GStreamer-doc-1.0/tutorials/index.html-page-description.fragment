If you have not done so yet, go\nto the <a href=\"../installing/index.html\">installing GStreamer</a> page and come back here afterwards.</p>\n<p>The tutorials are currently written only in the C programming language,\nso you need to be comfortable with it. Even though C is not an\nObject-Oriented (OO) language per se, the GStreamer framework uses\n<code>GObject</code>s, so some knowledge of OO concepts will come in handy.\nKnowledge of the <code>GObject</code> and <code>GLib</code> libraries is not mandatory, but\nwill make the trip easier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"source-code\">Source code</h3>\n<p>Every tutorial represents a self-contained project, with full source\ncode in C (and eventually in other languages too). Source code\nsnippets are introduced alongside the text, and the full code (with\nany other required files like makefiles or project files) is\ndistributed with GStreamer, as explained in the installation\ninstructions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-short-note-on-gobject-and-glib\">A short note on GObject and GLib</h3>\n<p>GStreamer is built on top of the <code>GObject</code> (for object orientation) and\n<code>GLib</code> (for common algorithms) libraries, which means that every now and\nthen you will have to call functions of these libraries. Even though the\ntutorials will make sure that deep knowledge of these libraries is not\nrequired, familiarity with them will certainly ease the process of\nlearning GStreamer.</p>\n<p>You can always tell which library you are calling because all GStreamer\nfunctions, structures and types have the <code>gst_</code> prefix, whereas GLib and\nGObject use <code>g_</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sources-of-documentation\">Sources of documentation</h3>\n<p>You have the <code>GObject</code> and <code>GLib</code> reference guides, and, of course the\nupstream <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/\">GStreamer documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structure\">Structure</h3>\n<p>The tutorials are organized in sections, revolving about a common theme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"basic/index.html\">Basic tutorials</a>: Describe general topics required to understand\nthe rest of tutorials in GStreamer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"playback/index.html\">Playback tutorials</a>: Explain everything you need to know to produce\na media playback application using GStreamer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"android/index.html\">Android tutorials</a>: Tutorials dealing with the few Android-specific\ntopics you need to know.</li>\n<li><a href=\"ios/index.html\">iOS tutorials</a>: Tutorials dealing with the few iOS-specific topics\nyou need to know.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you cannot remember in which tutorial a certain GStreamer concept is\nexplained, use the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"table-of-concepts.html\">Table of Concepts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"sample-media\">Sample media</h3>\n<p>The audio and video clips used throughout these tutorials are all\npublicly available and the copyright remains with their respective\nauthors. In some cases they have been re-encoded for demonstration\npurposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sintel.org/\">Sintel, the Durian Open Movie Project</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
