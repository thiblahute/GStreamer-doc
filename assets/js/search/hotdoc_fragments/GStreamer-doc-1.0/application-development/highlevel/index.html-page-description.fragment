Many people will, however, not need so much control (and as\nmuch code), but will prefer to use a standard playback interface that\ndoes most of the difficult internals for them. In this chapter, we will\nintroduce you into the concept of autopluggers, playback managing\nelements and other such things. Those higher-level interfaces are\nintended to simplify GStreamer-based application programming. They do,\nhowever, also reduce the flexibility. It is up to the application\ndeveloper to choose which interface he will want to use.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
