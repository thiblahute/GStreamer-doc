We will use a\nvisual representation of these objects so that we can visualize the more\ncomplex pipelines you will learn to build later on. You will get a first\nglance at the GStreamer API, which should be enough for building\nelementary applications. Later on in this part, you will also learn to\nbuild a basic command-line application.</p>\n<p>Note that this part will give a look into the low-level API and concepts\nof GStreamer. Once you're going to build applications, you might want to\nuse higher-level APIs. Those will be discussed later on in this manual.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
