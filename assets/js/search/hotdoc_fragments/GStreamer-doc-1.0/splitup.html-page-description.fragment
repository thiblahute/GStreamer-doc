Without further ado ...</p>\n<h2 id=\"gstreamer-hung-by-a-thread\">GStreamer - Hung by a Thread</h2>\n<p>Starring</p>\n<p>GSTREAMER</p>\n<p>The core around which all other modules revolve.  Base functionality and\nlibraries, some essential elements, documentation, and testing.</p>\n<p>BASE</p>\n<p>A well-groomed and well-maintained collection of GStreamer plug-ins and\nelements, spanning the range of possible types of elements one would want\nto write for GStreamer.</p>\n<p>And introducing, for the first time ever, on the development screen ...</p>\n<p>THE GOOD</p>\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Such ingratitude.  After all the times I've saved your life.</i></div>\n<p>A collection of plug-ins you'd want to have right next to you on the\nbattlefield.  Shooting sharp and making no mistakes, these plug-ins have it\nall: good looks, good code, and good licensing.  Documented and dressed up\nin tests.  If you're looking for a role model to base your own plug-in on,\nhere it is.</p>\n<p>If you find a plot hole or a badly lip-synced line of code in them,\nlet us know - it is a matter of honour for us to ensure Blondie doesn't look\nlike he's been walking 100 miles through the desert without water.</p>\n<p>THE UGLY</p>\n<div align=\"right\"><i>When you have to shoot, shoot.  Don't talk.</i></div>\n<p>There are times when the world needs a color between black and white.\nQuality code to match the good's, but two-timing, backstabbing and ready to\nsell your freedom down the river.  These plug-ins might have a patent noose\naround their neck, or a lock-up license, or any other problem that makes you\nthink twice about shipping them.</p>\n<p>We don't call them ugly because we like them less.  Does a mother love her\nson less because he's not as pretty as the other ones ? No  - she commends\nhim on his great personality.  These plug-ins are the life of the party.\nAnd we'll still step in and set them straight if you report any unacceptable\nbehaviour - because there are two kinds of people in the world, my friend:\nthose with a rope around their neck and the people who do the cutting.</p>\n<p>THE BAD</p>\n<div align=\"right\"><i>That an accusation?</i></div>\n<p>No perfectly groomed moustache or any amount of fine clothing is going to\ncover up the truth - these plug-ins are Bad with a capital B.\nThey look fine on the outside, and might even appear to get the job done, but\nat the end of the day they're a black sheep. Without a golden-haired angel\nto watch over them, they'll probably land in an unmarked grave at the final\nshowdown.</p>\n<p>Don't bug us about their quality - exercise your Free Software rights,\npatch up the offender and send us the patch on the fastest steed you can\nsteal from the Confederates. Because you see, in this world, there's two\nkinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig.\nYou dig.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-lowdown\">The Lowdown</h2>\n<div align=\"right\"><i>I've never seen so many plug-ins wasted so badly.</i></div>\n<p>GStreamer Plugins has grown so big that it's hard to separate the wheat from\nthe chaff.  Also, distributors have brought up issues about the legal status\nof some of the plug-ins we ship.  To remedy this, we've divided the previous\nset of available plug-ins into four modules:</p>\n<h3 id=\"gstpluginsbase\">gst-plugins-base</h3>\n<p>a small and fixed set of plug-ins, covering a wide range\nof possible types of elements; these are continuously kept up-to-date\nwith any core changes during the development series.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We believe distributors can safely ship these plug-ins</li>\n<li>People writing elements should base their code on these elements</li>\n<li>These elements come with examples, documentation, and regression tests</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"gstpluginsgood\">gst-plugins-good</h3>\n<p>a set of plug-ins that we consider to have good quality\ncode, correct functionality, our preferred license (LGPL for the plug-in\ncode, LGPL or LGPL-compatible for the supporting library).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We believe distributors can safely ship these plug-ins</li>\n<li>People writing elements should base their code on these elements</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"gstpluginsugly\">gst-plugins-ugly</h3>\n<p>a set of plug-ins that have good quality and correct\nfunctionality, but distributing them might pose problems.  The license\non either the plug-ins or the supporting libraries might not be how we'd\nlike. The code might be widely known to present patent problems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distributors should check if they want/can ship these plug-ins</li>\n<li>People writing elements should base their code on these elements</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"gstpluginsbad\">gst-plugins-bad</h3>\n<p>a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared to the\nrest.  They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing\nsomething - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests,\na real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.</p>\n<p>If the blanks are filled in they might be upgraded to become part of\neither gst-plugins-good or gst-plugins-ugly, depending on the other factors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the plug-ins break, you can't complain - instead, you can fix the\nproblem and send us a patch, or bribe someone into fixing them for you</li>\n<li>New contributors can start here for things to work on</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
