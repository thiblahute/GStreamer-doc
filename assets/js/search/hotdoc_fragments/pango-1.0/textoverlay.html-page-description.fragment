This can be either static text or text from buffers received on the text sink pad e.g. as produced by the subparse element. If the text sink pad is not linked the text set via the text property will be rendered. If the text sink pad is linked text will be rendered as it is received on that pad honouring and matching the buffer timestamps of both input streams. \nThe text can contain newline characters and text wrapping is enabled by default. \nHere is a simple pipeline that displays a static text in the top left corner of the video picture \nHere is another pipeline that displays subtitles from an srt subtitle file centered at the bottom of the picture and with a rectangular shading around the text in the background \nIf you do not have such a subtitle file create one looking like this in a text editor \n"});
