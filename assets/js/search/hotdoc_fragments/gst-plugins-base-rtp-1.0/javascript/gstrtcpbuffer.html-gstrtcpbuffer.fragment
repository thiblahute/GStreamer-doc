These buffers are typically of application x rtcp Gst.Caps. \nAn RTCP buffer consists of or more GstRtp.RTCPPacket structures that you can retrieve with GstRtp.RTCPBuffer.prototype.get_first_packet. GstRtp.RTCPPacket acts as a pointer into the RTCP buffer you can move to the next packet with GstRtp.RTCPPacket.prototype.move_to_next. \n"});
