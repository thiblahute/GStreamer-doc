It can be used for payloading audio codecs. It will only work with constant bitrate codecs. It supports both frame based and sample based codecs. It takes care of packing up the audio data into RTP packets and filling up the headers accordingly. The payloading is done based on the maximum MTU mtu and the maximum time per packet max ptime The general idea is to divide large data buffers into smaller RTP packets. The RTP packet size is the minimum of either the MTU max ptime if set or available data. The RTP packet size is always larger or equal to min ptime if set If min ptime is not set any residual data is sent in a last RTP packet. In the case of frame based codecs the resulting RTP packets always contain full frames. \n"});
