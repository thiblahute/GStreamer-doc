It can be used for payloading audio codecs. It will only work with constant bitrate codecs. It supports both frame based and sample based codecs. It takes care of packing up the audio data into RTP packets and filling up the headers accordingly. The payloading is done based on the maximum MTU mtu and the maximum time per packet max ptime The general idea is to divide large data buffers into smaller RTP packets. The RTP packet size is the minimum of either the MTU max ptime if set or available data. The RTP packet size is always larger or equal to min ptime if set If min ptime is not set any residual data is sent in a last RTP packet. In the case of frame based codecs the resulting RTP packets always contain full frames. \nTo use this base class your child element needs to call either Gst.Rtp.RTPBaseAudioPayload.SetFrameBased or Gst.Rtp.RTPBaseAudioPayload.SetSampleBased. This is usually done in the element s _init function. Then the child element must call either Gst.Rtp.RTPBaseAudioPayload.SetFrameOptions Gst.Rtp.RTPBaseAudioPayload.SetSampleOptions or gst_rtp_base_audio_payload_set_samplebits_options. Since GstRTPBaseAudioPayload derives from GstRTPBasePayload the child element must set any variables or call override any functions required by that base class. The child element does not need to override any other functions specific to GstRTPBaseAudioPayload. \n"});
