This must be freed with g_free after usage. \nGet the length of the Feedback Control Information attached to a RTPFB or PSFB packet. \nGet the media SSRC field of the RTPFB or PSFB packet. \nGet the sender SSRC field of the RTPFB or PSFB packet. \nSet the length of the Feedback Control Information attached to a RTPFB or PSFB packet. \nSet the media SSRC field of the RTPFB or PSFB packet. \nSet the sender SSRC field of the RTPFB or PSFB packet. \nAdd a new SDES entry to the current item in packet. \nAdd a new SDES item for ssrc to packet. \nThis function is like gst_rtcp_packet_sdes_get_entry but it returns a null terminated copy of the data instead. use g_free after usage. \nMove to the first SDES entry in the current item. \nMove to the first SDES item in packet. \nGet the data of the current SDES item entry. type when not NULL will contain the type of the entry. data when not NULL will point to len bytes. \nWhen type refers to a text item data will point to a UTF8 string. Note that this UTF8 string is NOT null terminated. Use gst_rtcp_packet_sdes_copy_entry to get a null terminated copy of the entry. \nGet the number of items in the SDES packet packet. \nGet the SSRC of the current SDES item. \nMove to the next SDES entry in the current item. \nMove to the next SDES item in packet. \nParse the SR sender info and store the values. \nSet the given values in the SR packet packet. \nCreate a new buffer and set the data to a copy of len bytes of data and the size to len. The data will be freed when the buffer is freed. \nCreate a new buffer and set the data and size of the buffer to data and len respectively. data will be freed when the buffer is unreffed so this function transfers ownership of data to the new buffer. \nCheck if the data and size point to the data of a valid compound non reduced size RTCP packet. Use this function to validate a packet before using the other functions in this module. \nCheck if the data and size point to the data of a valid RTCP packet. Use this function to validate a packet before using the other functions in this module. \nThis function is updated to support reduced size rtcp packets according to RFC and will validate full compound RTCP packets as well as reduced size RTCP packets. \nCheck if the data pointed to by buffer is a valid RTCP packet using gst_rtcp_buffer_validate_reduced. \nRequest an SR packet for early synchronization \nGST_RTCP_PSFB_TYPE_PLI \nMask for version padding bit and packet type pair allowing reduced size packets basically it accepts other types than RR and SR \n"});
