These buffers are typically of application x rtcp GstCaps. \nAn RTCP buffer consists of or more GstRTCPPacket structures that you can retrieve with gst_rtcp_buffer_get_first_packet. GstRTCPPacket acts as a pointer into the RTCP buffer you can move to the next packet with gst_rtcp_packet_move_to_next. \n"});
