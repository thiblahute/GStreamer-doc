This is usually done in the element s _init function. Then the child element must call either GstRtp.RTPBaseAudioPayload.set_frame_options GstRtp.RTPBaseAudioPayload.set_sample_options or gst_rtp_base_audio_payload_set_samplebits_options. Since GstRTPBaseAudioPayload derives from GstRTPBasePayload the child element must set any variables or call override any functions required by that base class. The child element does not need to override any other functions specific to GstRTPBaseAudioPayload. \n"});
