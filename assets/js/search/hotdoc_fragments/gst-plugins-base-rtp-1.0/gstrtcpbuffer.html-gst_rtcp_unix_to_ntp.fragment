The caller should pass a value with nanoseconds since The NTP time will in the upper bits contain the number of seconds since and in the lower bits the fractional seconds. The resulting value can be used as an ntptime for constructing SR RTCP packets. \nParameters \nan UNIX timestamp in nanoseconds \nthe NTP time for unixtime. \nConverts a UNIX timestamp in nanoseconds to an NTP time.
