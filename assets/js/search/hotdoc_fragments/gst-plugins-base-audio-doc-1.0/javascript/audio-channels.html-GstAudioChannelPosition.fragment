In the caps the\nactual channel layout is expressed with a channel count and a channel mask,\nwhich describes the existing channels. The positions in the bit mask correspond\nto the enum values.\nFor negotiation it is allowed to have more bits set in the channel mask than\nthe number of channels to specify the allowed channel positions but this is\nnot allowed in negotiated caps. It is not allowed in any situation other\nthan the one mentioned below to have less bits set in the channel mask than\nthe number of channels.</p>\n<p><em>GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_MONO</em> can only be used with a single mono channel that\nhas no direction information and would be mixed into all directional channels.\nThis is expressed in caps by having a single channel and no channel mask.</p>\n<p><em>GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE</em> can only be used if all channels have this position.\nThis is expressed in caps by having a channel mask with no bits set.</p>\n<p>As another special case it is allowed to have two channels without a channel mask.\nThis implicitely means that this is a stereo stream with a front left and front right\nchannel.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
