If needed mandatory events such as stream start caps and segment events will be sent before pushing the buffer. \nRetrieves the latency values reported by self in response to the latency query or Gst.CLOCK_TIME_NONE if there is not live source connected and the element will not wait for the clock. \nTypically only called by subclasses. \nIterate the sinkpads of aggregator to call a function on them. \nThis method guarantees that func will be called only once for each sink pad. \nLets GstBadBase.Aggregator sub classes tell the baseclass what their internal latency is. Will also post a LATENCY message on the bus so the pipeline can reconfigure its global latency. \nSets the caps to be used on the src pad. \nGType sinkpads_type \nOptional. The type of the pads that should be created when GstElement.request_new_pad is called. \ngpointer _gst_reserved \nThe implementation the GstPad to use with GstBadBase.Aggregator \nDrop the buffer currently queued in pad. \nSteal the ref to the buffer currently queued in pad. \ngpointer _gst_reserved \n"});
