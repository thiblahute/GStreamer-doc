This ensures that the table does not become too big. However the interpolation increases the CPU usage considerably. As an alternative a full sinc table can be used. Doing so can drastically reduce CPU usage x faster with kHz conversions for example at the cost of increased memory consumption plus the sinc table takes longer to initialize when the element is created. A third mode exists which uses the full table unless said table would become too large in which case the interpolated one is used instead. \n"});
