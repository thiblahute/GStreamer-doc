If alpha was set to both clips would be equally visible and if it was set to media1 would be invisible and media2 completely opaque. \npath uri \nSpecifies the location of the sample to make a clip from. \ninpoint i \nSets the inpoint of the clip that is the position in the original sample at which the clip will start outputting data. \nIt is an error to have an inpoint superior to the actual duration of the original sample. \nby default. \nduration i \nSets the duration of the clip that is the duration of the media the clip will output. \nIt is an error to have inpoint duration be superior to the duration of the original sample. \nThe default is the duration of the original sample the inpoint of the clip. \nstart s \nSets the start of the clip that is its position in the timeline. \nIf not specified it will be set to the duration of the layer the clip is added on as the expected default behaviour is to queue clips one after another. \nlayer l \nSets the layer of the clip. The video stream in overlapping clips on different layers will be blended together according to their alpha property starting with the clip on the last layer. An example is shown in the EXAMPLES section. \nIf not specified it will be set to the last layer a clip has been added on or a first layer if no clip has been added yet. \nThese have no effects if there is no video stream in the sample. \nalpha \nThis is the amount of transparency of the clip ranging from to Clips overlapping on different layers will be composited together unless disable mixing has been specified in the order of the layers. \nposx \nThis is the x position offset of the clip in pixels relatively to the output frame of the timeline. \nposy \nThis is the y position offset of the clip in pixels relatively to the output frame of the timeline. \nwidth \nThis is the width in pixels that the clip will occupy in the final output frame. \nheight \nThis is the height in pixels that the clip will occupy in the final output frame. \nvolume \nThis is the volume that will be set on the audio part of the clip ranging from to with being the default. \nmute \nSet to true to mute the audio of the clip. Default is false. \nbin description \nSpecifies the description of a GStreamer a bin in the gst launch format. \nProperties can be set on the effect either directly in the bin description or separately through the set command which will lookup any readable property in any of the children of the bin and set the provided value on it. \nThis will apply the agingtv effect to media and play it back. \nSets the property of an object for example a clip or an effect Trying to set a property than can t be looked up is considered an error. \nBy default set will lookup the property on the last added object. \nThis will set the alpha property on media then play it back assuming media contains a video stream. \nThis will set the dusts property of the agingtv to false and play the timeline back. \nload l \nLoad project from file. The project be saved again with the save option. \ns save Save project to file before rendering. It can then be loaded with the load option \np sample path If some assets are missing when loading a project file ges launch will try to locate them in this path. It is especially useful when sharing a project. \nr sample path recurse \nIdentical to sample path but ges launch will also recurse in the subfolders to look for assets. \no outputuri \nIf set ges launch will render the specified timeline instead of playing it back. The default rendering format is ogv containing theora and vorbis. \nf format \nSet an encoding profile on the command line. See ges launch help profile for more information. This will have no effect if no outputuri has been specified. \ne encoding profile \nSet an encoding profile from a preset file. See ges launch help profile for more information. This will have no effect if no outputuri has been specified. \nt track types \nSpecify the track types to be created. When loading a project only relevant tracks will be added to the timeline. \nv videosink \nSet the videosink used for playback. \na audiosink \nSet the audiosink used for playback. \nm mute \nMute playback output. This has no effect when rendering. \ninspect action type \nInspect the available action types that can be defined in a scenario set with set scenario. Will list all action types if action type is empty. \nlist transitions \nList all valid transition types and exit. See ges launch help transition for more information. \ndisable mixing \nDo not use mixing elements to mix layers together. \nr repeat \nSet the number of times to repeat the timeline. \nset scenario \nges launch exposes gst validate functionalities such as scenarios. Scenarios describe actions to execute such as seeks or setting of properties. GES implements editing specific actions such as adding or removal of clips. \n"});
