This is equivalent to setting the environment variable G_DEBUG to fatal_warnings see the section environment variables below for further information \ngst debug STRING \nA comma separated list of category_name level pairs to specify debugging levels for each category. Level is in the range where will show no messages and will show all messages. The wildcard can be used to match category names. Note that the order of categories and levels is important wildcards at the end may override levels set earlier. The log levels are ERROR WARNING FIXME INFO DEBUG LOG TRACE MEMDUMP. Since GStreamer one can also use the debug level names e.g. gst debug sink LOG. A full description of the various debug levels can be found in the GStreamer core library API documentation in the Running GStreamer Applications section. \nUse gst debug help to show category names \nExample GST_CAT GST_ELEMENT_ oggdemux \ngst debug level LEVEL \nSets the threshold for printing debugging messages. A higher level will print more messages. The useful range is with the default being Level LOG level will show all information that is usually required for debugging purposes. Higher levels are only useful in very specific cases. See above for the full list of levels. \ngst debug no color \nGStreamer normally prints debugging messages so that the messages are color coded when printed to a terminal that handles ANSI escape sequences. Using this option causes GStreamer to print messages without color. Setting the GST_DEBUG_NO_COLOR environment variable will achieve the same thing. \ngst debug color mode \nGStreamer normally prints debugging messages so that the messages are color coded when printed to a terminal that handles ANSI escape sequences on nix or uses W32 console API to color the messages printed into a console on W32 Using this option causes GStreamer to print messages without color off or disable print messages with default colors on or auto or print messages using ANSI escape sequences for coloring unix Setting the GST_DEBUG_COLOR_MODE environment variable will achieve the same thing. \ngst debug disable \nDisables debugging. \ngst debug help \nPrints a list of available debug categories and their default debugging level. \ngst plugin spew \nGStreamer info flags to set Enable printout of errors while loading GStreamer plugins \ngst plugin path PATH \nAdd directories separated with to the plugin search path \ngst plugin load PLUGINS \nPreload plugins specified in a comma separated list. Another way to specify plugins to preload is to use the environment variable GST_PLUGIN_PATH \n\n"});
