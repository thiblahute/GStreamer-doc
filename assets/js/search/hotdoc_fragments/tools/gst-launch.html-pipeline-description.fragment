Elements can be put into bins of different sorts. Elements links and bins can be specified in a pipeline description in any order. \nElements \nELEMENTTYPE PROPERTY1 \nCreates an element of type ELEMENTTYPE and sets the PROPERTIES. \nProperties \nPROPERTY VALUE \nSets the property to the specified value. You can use gst inspect to find out about properties and allowed values of different elements. Enumeration properties can be set by name nick or value. \nBins \nBINTYPE. PROPERTY1 PIPELINE DESCRIPTION \nSpecifies that a bin of type BINTYPE is created and the given properties are set. Every element between the braces is put into the bin. Please note the dot that has to be used after the BINTYPE. You will almost never need this functionality it is only really useful for applications using the gst_launch_parse API with bin as bintype. That way it is possible to build partial pipelines instead of a full fledged top level pipeline. \nLinks \nSRCELEMENT PAD1 SINKELEMENT PAD1 SRCELEMENT PAD1 CAPS SINKELEMENT PAD1 \nLinks the element with name SRCELEMENT to the element with name SINKELEMENT using the caps specified in CAPS as a filter. Names can be set on elements with the name property. If the name is omitted the element that was specified directly in front of or after the link is used. This works across bins. If a padname is given the link is done with these pads. If no pad names are given all possibilities are tried and a matching pad is used. If multiple padnames are given both sides must have the same number of pads specified and multiple links are done in the given order. So the simplest link is a simple exclamation mark that links the element to the left of it to the element right of it. \nCaps \nMIMETYPE PROPERTY PROPERTY CAPS CAPS \nCreates a capability with the given mimetype and optionally with given properties. The mimetype can be escaped using or If you want to chain caps you can add more caps in the same format afterwards. \nProperties \nNAME TYPE VALUE in lists and ranges TYPE VALUE \nSets the requested property in capabilities. The name is an alphanumeric value and the type can have the following case insensitive values i or int for integer values or ranges f or float for float values or ranges or fourcc for FOURCC values b bool or boolean for boolean values s str or string for strings fraction for fractions framerate pixel aspect ratio l or list for lists If no type was given the following order is tried integer float boolean string. Integer values must be parsable by strtol floats by strtod FOURCC values may either be integers or strings. Boolean values are case insensitive yes no true or false and may like strings be escaped with or Ranges are in this format VALUE VALUE Lists use this format VALUE VALUE \n"});
