For each of those factories this signal is emitted. \nThe signal handler should return a GST_TYPE_AUTOPLUG_SELECT_RESULT enum value indicating what decodebin should do next. \nA value of GST_AUTOPLUG_SELECT_TRY will try to autoplug an element from factory. \nA value of GST_AUTOPLUG_SELECT_EXPOSE will expose pad without plugging any element to it. \nA value of GST_AUTOPLUG_SELECT_SKIP will skip factory and move to the next factory. \nThe signal handler will not be invoked if any of the previously registered signal handlers if any return a value other than GST_AUTOPLUG_SELECT_TRY. Which also means that if you return GST_AUTOPLUG_SELECT_TRY from one signal handler handlers that get registered next again if any can override that decision. \n"});
