Once this connection is open it will inspect the display configuration including the physical display geometry and then calculate the pixel aspect ratio. When receiving video frames with a different pixel aspect ratio XvImageSink will use hardware scaling to display the video frames correctly on display s pixel aspect ratio. Sometimes the calculated pixel aspect ratio can be wrong it is then possible to enforce a specific pixel aspect ratio using the pixel aspect ratio property. \n"});
