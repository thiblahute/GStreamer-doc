The output is raw audio video or subtitle streams. \ndecodebin3 differs from the previous decodebin decodebin2 in important ways \nsupports publication and selection of stream information via GstStreamCollection messages and GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAM events. \ndynamically switches stream connections internally and reuses decoder elements when stream selections change so that in the normal case it maintains decoder of each type video audio subtitle and only creates new elements when streams change and an existing decoder is not capable of handling the new format. \nsupports multiple input pads for the parallel decoding of auxilliary streams not muxed with the primary stream. \ndoes not handle network stream buffering. decodebin3 expects that network stream buffering is handled upstream before data is passed to it. \ndecodebin3 is still experimental API and a technology preview. Its behaviour and exposed API is subject to change. \n"});
