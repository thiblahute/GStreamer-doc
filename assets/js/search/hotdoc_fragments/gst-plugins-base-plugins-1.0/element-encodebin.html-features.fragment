If the presence property for a stream encoding profile is you can request any number of sink pads for it via the standard request pad gstreamer API or the request pad action signal. \nAvoid reencoding passthrough If the input stream is already encoded and is compatible with what the GstEncodingProfile expects then the stream won t be re encoded but just passed through downstream to the muxer or the output. \nMix pre encoded and raw streams as input. In addition to the passthrough feature above you can feed both raw audio video AND already encoded data to a pad. encodebin will take care of passing through the compatible segments and re encoding the segments of media that need encoding. \nStandard behaviour is to use a GstEncodingContainerProfile to have both encoding and muxing performed. But you can also provide a single stream profile like GstEncodingAudioProfile to only have the encoding done and handle the encoded output yourself. \nAudio imperfection corrections. Incoming audio streams can have non perfect timestamps jitter like the streams coming from ASF files. encodebin will automatically fix those imperfections for you. See audio jitter tolerance for more details. \nVariable or Constant video framerate. If your GstEncodingVideoProfile has the variableframerate property deactivated default then the incoming raw video stream will be retimestampped in order to produce a constant framerate. \nCross boundary re encoding. When feeding compatible pre encoded streams that fall on segment boundaries and for supported formats right now only H263 the GOP will be decoded reencoded when needed to produce an encoded output that fits exactly within the request GstSegment. \nMissing plugin support. If a GstElement is missing to encode mux to the request profile formats a missing plugin GstMessage will be posted on the GstBus allowing systems that support the missing plugin system to offer the user a way to install the missing element. \n"});
