The file descriptors can be added to multifdsink by emitting the add signal. For each descriptor added the client added signal will be called. \nThe multifdsink element needs to be set into READY PAUSED or PLAYING state before operations such as adding clients are possible. \nA client can also be added with the add full signal that allows for more control over what and how much data a client initially receives. \nClients can be removed from multifdsink by emitting the remove signal. For each descriptor removed the client removed signal will be called. The client removed signal can also be fired when multifdsink decides that a client is not active anymore or depending on the value of the recover policy property if the client is reading too slowly. In all cases multifdsink will never close a file descriptor itself. The user of multifdsink is responsible for closing all file descriptors. This can for example be done in response to the client fd removed signal. Note that multifdsink still has a reference to the file descriptor when the client removed signal is emitted so that get stats can be performed on the descriptor it is therefore not safe to close the file descriptor in the client removed signal handler and you should use the client fd removed signal to safely close the fd. \nMultifdsink internally keeps a queue of the incoming buffers and uses a separate thread to send the buffers to the clients. This ensures that no client write can block the pipeline and that clients can read with different speeds. \nWhen adding a client to multifdsink the sync method property will define which buffer in the queued buffers will be sent first to the client. Clients can be sent the most recent buffer which might not be decodable by the client if it is not a keyframe the next keyframe received in multifdsink which can take some time depending on the keyframe rate or the last received keyframe which will cause a simple burst on connect Multifdsink will always keep at least one keyframe in its internal buffers when the sync mode is set to latest keyframe. \nThere are additional values for the sync method property to allow finer control over burst on connect behaviour. By selecting the burst method a minimum burst size can be chosen burst keyframe additionally requires that the burst begin with a keyframe and burst with keyframe attempts to burst beginning with a keyframe but will prefer a minimum burst size even if it requires not starting with a keyframe. \nMultifdsink can be instructed to keep at least a minimum amount of data expressed in time or byte units in its internal queues with the time min and bytes min properties respectively. These properties are useful if the application adds clients with the add full signal to make sure that a burst connect can actually be honored. \nWhen streaming data clients are allowed to read at a different rate than the rate at which multifdsink receives data. If the client is reading too fast no data will be send to the client until multifdsink receives more data. If the client however reads too slowly data for that client will be queued up in multifdsink. Two properties control the amount of data buffers that is queued in multifdsink buffers max and buffers soft max. A client that falls behind by buffers max is removed from multifdsink forcibly. \nA client with a lag of at least buffers soft max enters the recovery procedure which is controlled with the recover policy property. A recover policy of NONE will do nothing RESYNC_LATEST will send the most recently received buffer as the next buffer for the client RESYNC_SOFT_LIMIT positions the client to the soft limit in the buffer queue and RESYNC_KEYFRAME positions the client at the most recent keyframe in the buffer queue. \nmultifdsink will by default synchronize on the clock before serving the buffers to the clients. This behaviour can be disabled by setting the sync property to FALSE. Multifdsink will by default not do QoS and will never drop late buffers. \n"});
