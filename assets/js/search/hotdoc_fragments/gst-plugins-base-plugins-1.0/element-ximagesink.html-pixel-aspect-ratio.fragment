Once this connection is open it will inspect the display configuration including the physical display geometry and then calculate the pixel aspect ratio. When caps negotiation will occur the video sink will set the calculated pixel aspect ratio on the caps to make sure that incoming video frames will have the correct pixel aspect ratio for this display. Sometimes the calculated pixel aspect ratio can be wrong it is then possible to enforce a specific pixel aspect ratio using the pixel aspect ratio property. \n"});
