It also handles seek queries in said raw video data and ensures that output buffers contain exactly one frame even if the input buffers contain only partial frames or multiple frames. In the former case it will continue to receive buffers until there is enough input data to output one frame. In the latter case it will extract the first frame in the buffer and output it then the second one etc. until the remaining unparsed bytes aren t enough to form a complete frame and it will then continue as described in the earlier case. \nThe element implements the properties and sink caps configuration as specified in the GstRawBaseParse documentation. The properties configuration can be modified by using the width height pixel aspect ratio framerate interlaced top field first plane strides plane offsets and frame size properties. \nIf the properties configuration is used plane strides and offsets will be computed by using gst_video_info_set_format. This can be overridden by passing GstValueArrays to the plane offsets and plane strides properties. When this is done these custom offsets and strides are used later even if new width height format etc. property values might be set. To switch back to computed plane strides offsets pass NULL to one or both of the plane offset and plane array properties. \nThe frame size property is useful in cases where there is extra data between the frames for example trailing metadata or headers The parser calculates the actual frame size out of the other properties and compares it with this frame size value. If the frame size is larger than the calculated size then the extra bytes after the end of the frame are skipped. For example with bit grayscale frames and a actual frame size of x10 pixels and a frame size of bytes there are excess bytes at the end of the actual frame which are then skipped. It is safe to set the frame size to a value that is smaller than the actual frame size in fact its default value is if it is smaller then no trailing data will be skipped. \nIf a framerate of Hz is set for example then output buffers will have no duration set. The first output buffer will have a PTS all subsequent ones an unset PTS. \n"});
