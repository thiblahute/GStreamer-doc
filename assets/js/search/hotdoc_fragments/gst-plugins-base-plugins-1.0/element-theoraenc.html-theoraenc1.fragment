Theora is a royalty free video codec maintained by the Xiph.org Foundation based on the VP3 codec. \nThe theora codec internally only supports encoding of images that are a multiple of pixels in both X and Y direction. It is however perfectly possible to encode images with other dimensions because an arbitrary rectangular cropping region can be set up. This element will automatically set up a correct cropping region if the dimensions are not multiples of pixels. \nTo control the quality of the encoding the GstTheoraEnc bitrate and GstTheoraEnc quality properties can be used. These two properties are mutualy exclusive. Setting the bitrate property will produce a constant bitrate CBR stream while setting the quality property will produce a variable bitrate VBR stream. \nA videorate element is often required in front of theoraenc especially when transcoding and when putting Theora into the Ogg container. \n"});
