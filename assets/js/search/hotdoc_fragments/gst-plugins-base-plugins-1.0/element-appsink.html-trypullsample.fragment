fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "gst-plugins-base-plugins-1.0/element-appsink.html#trypullsample", "fragment": "try pull sample \nThis function blocks until a sample or EOS becomes available or the appsink element is set to the READY NULL state or the timeout expires. \nThis function will only return samples when the appsink is in the PLAYING state. All rendered samples will be put in a queue so that the application can pull samples at its own rate. \nNote that when the application does not pull samples fast enough the queued samples could consume a lot of memory especially when dealing with raw video frames. It s possible to control the behaviour of the queue with the drop and max buffers properties. \nIf an EOS event was received before any buffers or the timeout expires this function returns NULL. Use gst_app_sink_is_eos to check for the EOS condition. \n"});
