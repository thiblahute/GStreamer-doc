This ensures that the table does not become too big. However, the interpolation\nincreases the CPU usage considerably. As an alternative, a full sinc table can be used.\nDoing so can drastically reduce CPU usage (4x faster with 44.1 -&gt; 48 kHz conversions for\nexample), at the cost of increased memory consumption, plus the sinc table takes longer\nto initialize when the element is created. A third mode exists, which uses the full table\nunless said table would become too large, in which case the interpolated one is used instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-launch-line\">Example launch line</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-[\"> gst-launch-1.0 -v uridecodebin uri=file:///path/to/audio.ogg ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! audio/x-raw, rate=8000 ! autoaudiosink\n</code></pre>\n<p>Decode an audio file and downsample it to 8Khz and play sound.\nTo create the Ogg/Vorbis file refer to the documentation of vorbisenc.\nThis assumes there is an audio sink that will accept/handle 8kHz audio.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
