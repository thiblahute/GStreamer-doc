This can potentially cause performance degradation. Note that property notification will happen from the streaming thread so applications should be prepared for this. \nIf the tolerance property is non zero and an incoming buffer s timestamp deviates less than the property indicates from what would make a perfect time then no samples will be added or dropped. Note that the output is still guaranteed to be a perfect stream which means that the incoming data is then simply shifted by less than the indicated tolerance to a perfect time. \n"});
