It includes the results of discussions with lawyers including official representatives of the FSF to help us ensure we cover the legal issues as correctly as possible. This does not mean the FSF or anyone else endorse the opinions in this page. The opinions only represent the rough consensus of the GStreamer community. The advice contained in here is meant as information and guidance for people developing free and open source software using the GStreamer library so they are aware of the consequences of their choices. People developing proprietary software or people distributing GStreamer might also find this document useful in order to understand how GStreamer works in a licensing context. \nThis text is also meant to explain a little about our thinking in regards to how to deal with the problem of software patents which is an even bigger pain in the field of multimedia than other fields of programming. \nFor more information on licensing you can check out our legal FAQ \n"});
