Mixed data is clamped to the min max values of the data format. \nUnlike the adder element audiomixer properly synchronises all input streams and also handles live inputs such as capture sources or RTP properly. \nCaps negotiation is inherently racy with the audiomixer element. You can set the caps property to force audiomixer to operate in a specific audio format sample rate and channel count. In this case you may also need audioconvert and or audioresample elements for each input stream before the audiomixer element to make sure the input branch can produce the forced format. \nThe input pads are from a GstPad subclass and have additional properties to mute each pad individually and set the volume \nThis pipeline produces two sine waves mixed together. \n"});
