Here s an example with GST_DEBUG \nAs you can see this is quite a bit of information. In fact the GStreamer debug log is so verbose that when fully enabled it can render applications unresponsive due to the console scrolling or fill up megabytes of text files when redirected to a file For this reason the logs are categorized and you seldom need to enable all categories at once. \nThe first category is the Debug Level which is a number specifying the amount of desired output \nTo enable debug output set the GST_DEBUG environment variable to the desired debug level. All levels below that will also be shown i.e. if you set GST_DEBUG you will get both ERROR and WARNING messages \nFurthermore each plugin or part of the GStreamer defines its own category so you can specify a debug level for each individual category. For example GST_DEBUG audiotestsrc will use Debug Level for the audiotestsrc element and for all the others. \nThe GST_DEBUG environment variable then is a comma separated list of category level pairs with an optional level at the beginning representing the default debug level for all categories. \nThe wildcard is also available. For example GST_DEBUG audio will use Debug Level for all categories starting with the word audio. GST_DEBUG is equivalent to GST_DEBUG \nUse gst launch gst debug help to obtain the list of all registered categories. Bear in mind that each plugin registers its own categories so when installing or removing plugins this list can change. \nUse GST_DEBUG when the error information posted on the GStreamer bus does not help you nail down a problem. It is common practice to redirect the output log to a file and then examine it later searching for specific messages. \nThe content of each line in the debug output is \n"});
