It allows you to quickly check if a given pipeline works before going through the actual implementation using GStreamer API calls. \nBear in mind that it can only create simple pipelines. In particular it can only simulate the interaction of the pipeline with the application up to a certain level. In any case it is extremely handy to test pipelines quickly and is used by GStreamer developers around the world on a daily basis. \nPlease note that gst launch is primarily a debugging tool for developers. You should not build applications on top of it. Instead use the gst_parse_launch function of the GStreamer API as an easy way to construct pipelines from pipeline descriptions. \nAlthough the rules to construct pipeline descriptions are very simple the concatenation of multiple elements can quickly make such descriptions resemble black magic. Fear not for everyone learns the gst launch syntax eventually. \nThe command line for gst launch consists of a list of options followed by a PIPELINE DESCRIPTION. Some simplified instructions are given next se the complete documentation at the reference page for gst launch \n"});
