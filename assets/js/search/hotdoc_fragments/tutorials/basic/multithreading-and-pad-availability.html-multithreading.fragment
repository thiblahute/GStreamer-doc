This means that internally it creates and destroys threads as it needs them for example to decouple streaming from the application thread. Moreover plugins are also free to create threads for their own processing for example a video decoder could create threads to take full advantage of a CPU with cores. \nOn top of this when building the pipeline an application can specify explicitly that a branch a part of the pipeline runs on a different thread for example to have the audio and video decoders executing simultaneously \nThis is accomplished using the queue element which works as follows. The sink pad just enqueues data and returns control. On a different thread data is dequeued and pushed downstream. This element is also used for buffering as seen later in the streaming tutorials. The size of the queue can be controlled through properties. \n"});
