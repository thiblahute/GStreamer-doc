In this way you have all debug output in the same file and the temporal relationship between different messages is preserved. \nTo do so use the GST_ERROR GST_WARNING GST_INFO GST_LOG and GST_DEBUG macros. They accept the same parameters as printf and they use the default category default will be shown as the Debug category in the output log \nTo change the category to something more meaningful add these two lines at the top of your code \nAnd then this one after you have initialized GStreamer with gst_init \nThis registers a new category this is for the duration of your application it is not stored in any file and sets it as the default category for your code. See the documentation for GST_DEBUG_CATEGORY_INIT \n"});
