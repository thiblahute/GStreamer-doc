The correction is performed by dropping and duplicating frames no fancy algorithm is used to interpolate frames. \nThis is useful to allow elements requiring different frame rates to link. As with the other adapters if it is not needed because there is a frame rate on which both Pads can agree it acts in pass through mode and does not impact performance. \nIt is therefore a good idea to always use it whenever the actual frame rate is unknown at design time just in case. \n"});
