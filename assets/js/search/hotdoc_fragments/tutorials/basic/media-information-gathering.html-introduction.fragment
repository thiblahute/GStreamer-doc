It can work in synchronous or asynchronous modes. \nIn synchronous mode there is only a single function to call gst_discoverer_discover_uri which blocks until the information is ready. Due to this blocking it is usually less interesting for GUI based applications and the asynchronous mode is used as described in this tutorial. \nThe recovered information includes codec descriptions stream topology number of streams and sub streams and available metadata like the audio language \nAs an example this is the result of discovering https www.freedesktop.org software gstreamer sdk data media sintel_trailer p.webm \nThe following code tries to discover the URI provided through the command line and outputs the retrieved information If no URI is provided it uses a default one \nThis is a simplified version of what the gst discoverer tool does Basic tutorial GStreamer tools which is an application that only displays data but does not perform any playback. \n"});
