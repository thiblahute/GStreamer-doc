In particular in this example we move the message handling code to its own function handle_message because it is growing a bit too big. \nWe would then build a pipeline composed of a single element a playbin which we already saw in Basic tutorial Hello world However playbin is in itself a pipeline and in this case it is the only element in the pipeline so we use directly the playbin element. We will skip the details the URI of the clip is given to playbin via the URI property and the pipeline is set to the playing state. \nPreviously we did not provide a timeout to gst_bus_timed_pop_filtered meaning that it didn t return until a message was received. Now we use a timeout of milliseconds so if no message is received times per second the function will return with a NULL instead of a GstMessage. We are going to use this to update our UI Note that the timeout period is specified in nanoseconds so usage of the GST_SECOND or GST_MSECOND macros is highly recommended. \nIf we got a message we process it in the handle_message function next subsection otherwise \n"});
