It is the object responsible for delivering to the application the GstMessages generated by the elements in order and to the application thread. This last point is important because the actual streaming of media is done in another thread than the application. \nMessages can be extracted from the bus synchronously with gst_bus_timed_pop_filtered and its siblings or asynchronously using signals shown in the next tutorial Your application should always keep an eye on the bus to be notified of errors and other playback related issues. \nThe rest of the code is the cleanup sequence which is the same as in Basic tutorial Hello world \n"});
