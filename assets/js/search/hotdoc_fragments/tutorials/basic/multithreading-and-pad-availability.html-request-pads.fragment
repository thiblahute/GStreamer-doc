These are called Sometimes Pads and contrast with the regular pads which are always available and are called Always Pads. \nThe third kind of pad is the Request Pad which is created on demand. The classical example is the tee element which has one sink pad and no initial source pads they need to be requested and then tee adds them. In this way an input stream can be replicated any number of times. The disadvantage is that linking elements with Request Pads is not as automatic as linking Always Pads as the walkthrough for this example will show. \nAlso to request or release pads in the PLAYING or PAUSED states you need to take additional cautions Pad blocking which are not described in this tutorial. It is safe to request or release pads in the NULL or READY states though. \nWithout further delay let s see the code. \n"});
