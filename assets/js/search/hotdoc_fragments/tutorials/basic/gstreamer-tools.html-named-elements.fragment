Names allow linking to elements created previously in the description and are indispensable to use elements with multiple output pads like demuxers or tees for example. \nNamed elements are referred to using their name followed by a dot. \nYou should see two video windows showing the same sample video pattern. If you see only one try to move it since it is probably on top of the second window. \nThis example instantiates a videotestsrc linked to a videoconvert linked to a tee Remember from Basic tutorial Multithreading and Pad Availability that a tee copies to each of its output pads everything coming through its input pad The tee is named simply t using the name property and then linked to a queue and an autovideosink. The same tee is referred to using t. mind the dot and then linked to a second queue and a second autovideosink. \nTo learn why the queues are necessary read Basic tutorial Multithreading and Pad Availability. \n"});
