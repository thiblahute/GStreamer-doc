Internally it creates and connects all the necessary elements to play your media so you do not have to worry about it. \nIt does not allow the control granularity that a manual pipeline does but still it permits enough customization to suffice for a wide range of applications. Including this tutorial. \nIn this example we are only passing one parameter to playbin which is the URI of the media we want to play. Try changing it to something else Whether it is an http or file URI playbin will instantiate the appropriate GStreamer source transparently \nIf you mistype the URI or the file does not exist or you are missing a plug in GStreamer provides several notification mechanisms but the only thing we are doing in this example is exiting on error so do not expect much feedback. \nThis line highlights another interesting concept the state. Every GStreamer element has an associated state which you can more or less think of as the Play Pause button in your regular DVD player. For now suffice to say that playback will not start unless you set the pipeline to the PLAYING state. \nIn this line gst_element_set_state is setting pipeline our only element remember to the PLAYING state thus initiating playback. \nThese lines will wait until an error occurs or the end of the stream is found. gst_element_get_bus retrieves the pipeline s bus and gst_bus_timed_pop_filtered will block until you receive either an ERROR or an EOS End Of Stream through that bus. Do not worry much about this line the GStreamer bus is explained in Basic tutorial GStreamer concepts. \nAnd that s it From this point onwards GStreamer takes care of everything. Execution will end when the media reaches its end EOS or an error is encountered try closing the video window or unplugging the network cable The application can always be stopped by pressing control C in the console. \n"});
