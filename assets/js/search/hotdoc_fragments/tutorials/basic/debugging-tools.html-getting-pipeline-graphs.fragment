These are dot files readable with free programs like GraphViz that describe the topology of your pipeline along with the caps negotiated in each link. \nThis is also very handy when using all in one elements like playbin or uridecodebin which instantiate several elements inside them. Use the dot files to learn what pipeline they have created inside and learn a bit of GStreamer along the way \nTo obtain dot files simply set the GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR environment variable to point to the folder where you want the files to be placed. gst launch will create a dot file at each state change so you can see the evolution of the caps negotiation. Unset the variable to disable this facility. From within your application you can use the GST_DEBUG_BIN_TO_DOT_FILE and GST_DEBUG_BIN_TO_DOT_FILE_WITH_TS macros to generate dot files at your convenience. \nHere you have an example of the kind of pipelines that playbin generates. It is very complex because playbin can handle many different cases Your manual pipelines normally do not need to be this long. If your manual pipeline is starting to get very big consider using playbin. \n\nTo download the full size picture use the attachments link at the top of this page It s the paperclip icon \n"});
