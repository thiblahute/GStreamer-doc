fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "tutorials/basic/handy-elements.html#audiorate", "fragment": "audiorate \nThis element takes an incoming stream of time stamped raw audio frames and produces a perfect stream by inserting or dropping samples as needed. It does not allow the sample rate to be changed as videorate does it just fills gaps and removes overlapped samples so the output stream is continuous and clean \nIt is useful in situations where the timestamps are going to be lost when storing into certain file formats for example and the receiver will require all samples to be present. It is cumbersome to exemplify this so no example is given. \nMost of the time audiorate is not what you want. \n"});
