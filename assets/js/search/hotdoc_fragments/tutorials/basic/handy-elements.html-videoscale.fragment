By default the element tries to negotiate to the same size on the source and sink Pads so that no scaling is needed. It is therefore safe to insert this element in a pipeline to get more robust behavior without any cost if no scaling is needed. \nThis element supports a wide range of color spaces including various YUV and RGB formats and is therefore generally able to operate anywhere in a pipeline. \nIf the video is to be output to a window whose size is controlled by the user it is a good idea to use a videoscale element since not all video sinks are capable of performing scaling operations. \n"});
