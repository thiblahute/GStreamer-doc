In this example we ask the pipeline if seeking is allowed some sources like live streams do not allow seeking If it is allowed then once the movie has been running for ten seconds we skip to a different position using a seek. \nIn the previous tutorials once we had the pipeline setup and running our main function just sat and waited to receive an ERROR or an EOS through the bus. Here we modify this function to periodically wake up and query the pipeline for the stream position so we can print it on screen. This is similar to what a media player would do updating the User Interface on a periodic basis. \nFinally the stream duration is queried and updated whenever it changes. \n"});
