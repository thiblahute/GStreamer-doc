In these cases GStreamer will link using the first pad that is available which pretty much amounts to saying that GStreamer will choose one output pad at random. \nConsider the following pipeline \nThis is the same media file and demuxer as in the previous example. The input Pad Caps of filesink are ANY meaning that it can accept any kind of media. Which one of the two output pads of matroskademux will be linked against the filesink video_00 or audio_00 You cannot know. \nYou can remove this ambiguity though by using named pads as in the previous sub section or by using Caps Filters \nA Caps Filter behaves like a pass through element which does nothing and only accepts media with the given Caps effectively resolving the ambiguity. In this example between matroskademux and matroskamux we added a video x vp8 Caps Filter to specify that we are interested in the output pad of matroskademux which can produce this kind of video. \nTo find out the Caps an element accepts and produces use the gst inspect tool. To find out the Caps contained in a particular file use the gst discoverer tool. To find out the Caps an element is producing for a particular pipeline run gst launch as usual with the v option to print Caps information. \n"});
