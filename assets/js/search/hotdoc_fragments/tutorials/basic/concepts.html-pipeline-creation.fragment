fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "tutorials/basic/concepts.html#pipeline-creation", "fragment": "Pipeline creation \nAll elements in GStreamer must typically be contained inside a pipeline before they can be used because it takes care of some clocking and messaging functions. We create the pipeline with gst_pipeline_new \nA pipeline is a particular type of bin which is the element used to contain other elements. Therefore all methods which apply to bins also apply to pipelines. In our case we call gst_bin_add_many to add the elements to the pipeline mind the cast This function accepts a list of elements to be added ending with NULL. Individual elements can be added with gst_bin_add \nThese elements however are not linked with each other yet. For this we need to use gst_element_link Its first parameter is the source and the second one the destination. The order counts because links must be established following the data flow this is from source elements to sink elements Keep in mind that only elements residing in the same bin can be linked together so remember to add them to the pipeline before trying to link them \n"});
