Changing states is a delicate process and a few more details are given in Basic tutorial Dynamic pipelines. \ngst_bus_timed_pop_filtered waits for execution to end and returns with a GstMessage which we previously ignored. We asked gst_bus_timed_pop_filtered to return when GStreamer encountered either an error condition or an EOS so we need to check which one happened and print a message on screen Your application will probably want to undertake more complex actions \nGstMessage is a very versatile structure which can deliver virtually any kind of information. Fortunately GStreamer provides a series of parsing functions for each kind of message. \nIn this case once we know the message contains an error by using the GST_MESSAGE_TYPE macro we can use gst_message_parse_error which returns a GLib GError error structure and a string useful for debugging. Examine the code to see how these are used and freed afterward. \n"});
