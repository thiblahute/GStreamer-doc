Reverse playback does the same thing but backwards from the end of the stream to the beginning. \nAll these techniques do is change the playback rate which is a variable equal to for normal playback greater than in absolute value for fast modes lower than in absolute value for slow modes positive for forward playback and negative for reverse playback. \nGStreamer provides two mechanisms to change the playback rate Step Events and Seek Events. Step Events allow skipping a given amount of media besides changing the subsequent playback rate only to positive values Seek Events additionally allow jumping to any position in the stream and set positive and negative playback rates. \nIn Basic tutorial Time management seek events have already been shown using a helper function to hide their complexity. This tutorial explains a bit more how to use these events. \nStep Events are a more convenient way of changing the playback rate due to the reduced number of parameters needed to create them however they have some downsides so Seek Events are used in this tutorial instead. Step events only affect the sink at the end of the pipeline so they will only work if the rest of the pipeline can support going at a different speed Seek events go all the way through the pipeline so every element can react to them. The upside of Step events is that they are much faster to act. Step events are also unable to change the playback direction. \nTo use these events they are created and then passed onto the pipeline where they propagate upstream until they reach an element that can handle them. If an event is passed onto a bin element like playbin it will simply feed the event to all its sinks which will result in multiple seeks being performed. The common approach is to retrieve one of playbin s sinks through the video sink or audio sink properties and feed the event directly into the sink. \nFrame stepping is a technique that allows playing a video frame by frame. It is implemented by pausing the pipeline and then sending Step Events to skip one frame each time. \n"});
