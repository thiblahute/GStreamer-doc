We will introduce here the rest of states and their meaning. There are states in GStreamer \nYou can only move between adjacent ones this is you can t go from NULL to PLAYING you have to go through the intermediate READY and PAUSED states. If you set the pipeline to PLAYING though GStreamer will make the intermediate transitions for you. \nWe added this piece of code that listens to bus messages regarding state changes and prints them on screen to help you understand the transitions. Every element puts messages on the bus regarding its current state so we filter them out and only listen to messages coming from the pipeline. \nMost applications only need to worry about going to PLAYING to start playback then to PAUSE to perform a pause and then back to NULL at program exit to free all resources. \n"});
