Naming your elements is useful to retrieve them later if you didn t keep a pointer and for more meaningful debug output If you pass NULL for the name however GStreamer will provide a unique name for you. \nFor this tutorial we create two elements a videotestsrc and an autovideosink. \nvideotestsrc is a source element it produces data which creates a test video pattern. This element is useful for debugging purposes and tutorials and is not usually found in real applications. \nautovideosink is a sink element it consumes data which displays on a window the images it receives. There exist several video sinks depending on the operating system with a varying range of capabilities. autovideosink automatically selects and instantiates the best one so you do not have to worry with the details and your code is more platform independent. \n"});
