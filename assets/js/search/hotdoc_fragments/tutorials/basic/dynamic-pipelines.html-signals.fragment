They allow you to be notified by means of a callback when something interesting has happened. Signals are identified by a name and each GObject has its own signals. \nIn this line we are attaching to the pad added signal of our source an uridecodebin element To do so we use g_signal_connect and provide the callback function to be used pad_added_handler and a data pointer. GStreamer does nothing with this data pointer it just forwards it to the callback so we can share information with it. In this case we pass a pointer to the CustomData structure we built specially for this purpose. \nThe signals that a GstElement generates can be found in its documentation or using the gst inspect tool as described in Basic tutorial GStreamer tools. \nWe are now ready to go Just set the pipeline to the PLAYING state and start listening to the bus for interesting messages like ERROR or EOS just like in the previous tutorials. \n"});
