Media travels from the source elements the producers down to the sink elements the consumers passing through a series of intermediate elements performing all kinds of tasks. The set of all the interconnected elements is called a pipeline \nIn GStreamer you usually build the pipeline by manually assembling the individual elements but when the pipeline is easy enough and you do not need any advanced features you can take the shortcut gst_parse_launch \nThis function takes a textual representation of a pipeline and turns it into an actual pipeline which is very handy. In fact this function is so handy there is a tool built completely around it which you will get very acquainted with see Basic tutorial GStreamer tools to learn about gst launch and the gst launch syntax \n"});
