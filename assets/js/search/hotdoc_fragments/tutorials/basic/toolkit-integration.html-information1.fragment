The media is fetched from the Internet so the window might take a few seconds to appear depending on your connection speed. The Window has some GTK buttons to Pause Stop and Play the movie and a slider to show the current position of the stream which can be dragged to change it. Also information about the stream is shown on a column at the right edge of the window. \nBear in mind that there is no latency management buffering so on slow connections the movie might stop after a few seconds. See how Basic tutorial Streaming solves this issue. \nRequired libraries gstreamer video gtk gstreamer \n"});
