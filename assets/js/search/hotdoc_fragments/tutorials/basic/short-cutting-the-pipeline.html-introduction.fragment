This tutorial describes the easiest one since it uses elements that have been created for this sole purpose. \nThe element used to inject application data into a GStreamer pipeline is appsrc and its counterpart used to extract GStreamer data back to the application is appsink. To avoid confusing the names think of it from GStreamer s point of view appsrc is just a regular source that provides data magically fallen from the sky provided by the application actually appsink is a regular sink where the data flowing through a GStreamer pipeline goes to die it is recovered by the application actually \nappsrc and appsink are so versatile that they offer their own API see their documentation which can be accessed by linking against the gstreamer app library. In this tutorial however we will use a simpler approach and control them through signals. \nappsrc can work in a variety of modes in pull mode it requests data from the application every time it needs it. In push mode the application pushes data at its own pace. Furthermore in push mode the application can choose to be blocked in the push function when enough data has already been provided or it can listen to the enough data and need data signals to control flow. This example implements the latter approach. Information regarding the other methods can be found in the appsrc documentation. \n"});
