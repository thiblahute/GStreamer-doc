General GStreamer concepts will not be explained in these tutorials so the Basic tutorials should be reviewed first. The reader should also be familiar with basic Android programming techniques. \nEach Android tutorial builds on top of the previous one and adds progressively more functionality until a working media player application is obtained in Android tutorial A Complete media player. This is the same media player application used to advertise GStreamer on Android and the download link can be found in the Android tutorial A Complete media player page. \nMake sure to have read the instructions in Installing for Android development before jumping into the Android tutorials. \nAll Java methods both Android specific and generic are documented in the Android reference site. \nUnfortunately there is no official online documentation for the NDK. The header files though are well commented. If you installed the Android NDK in the ANDROID_NDK_ROOT folder you can find the header files in ANDROID_NDK_ROOT platforms android arch arm usr include android. \n"});
