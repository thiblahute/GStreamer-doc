Since playbin will be taking care of retrieving the media we can use local or remote URIs indistinctly file or http for example From Java though we want to keep track of whether the file is local or remote because we will not offer the same functionalities. We keep track of this in the is_local_media variable and update it every time we change the media URI \nWe call setMediaUri in the onGStreamerInitialized callback once the pipeline is ready to accept commands. \nJava code will call gst_native_set_uri whenever it wants to change the playing URI in this tutorial the URI never changes but it could \nWe first need to convert between the UTF16 encoding used by Java and the Modified UTF8 used by GStreamer with GetStringUTFChars and ReleaseStringUTFChars \nplaybin will only care about URI changes in the READY to PAUSED state change because the new URI might need a completely different playback pipeline think about switching from a local Matroska file to a remote OGG file this would require at least different source and demuxing elements Thus before passing the new URI to playbin we set its state to READY if we were in PAUSED or PLAYING \nplaybin s URI is exposed as a common GObject property so we simply set it with g_object_set \nWe then reset the clip duration so it is re queried later and bring the pipeline to the playing state it had before. In this last step we also take note of whether the new URI corresponds to a live source or not. Live sources must not use buffering otherwise latency is introduced which is inacceptable for them so we keep track of this information in the is_live variable. \nThe only line worth mentioning in the makefile is GSTREAMER_PLUGINS \njni Android.mk \nIn which all plugins required for playback are loaded because it is not known at build time what would be needed for an unspecified URI again in this tutorial the URI does not change but it will in the next one \n"});
