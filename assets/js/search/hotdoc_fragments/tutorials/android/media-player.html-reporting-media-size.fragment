Eventually the onMeasure method in GStreamerSurfaceView will be called and the new size will be taken into account. As we have already seen in Android tutorial A running pipeline methods which change the UI must be called from the main thread and we are now in a callback from some GStreamer internal thread. Hence the usage of runOnUiThread \n"});
