While this might be convenient sometimes it does not allow a great deal of control. In particular when the surface does not have the same aspect ratio as the media the sink will add black borders the known letterbox or pillarbox effect which is an unnecessary work and a waste of battery \nThe subclass of SurfaceView presented here overrides the onMeasure method to report the actual media size so the surface can adapt to any layout while preserving the media aspect ratio. \nSince in this tutorial the media size is known beforehand it is hardcoded in the GStreamerSurfaceView class for simplicity. The next tutorial shows how it can be recovered at runtime and passed onto the surface. \nsrc org freedesktop gstreamer tutorials tutorial_3 GStreamerSurfaceView.java \n"});
