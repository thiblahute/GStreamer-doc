The implementation on Android is very similar. \nThe Seek Bar accomplishes to functions First it moves on its own to reflect the current playback position in the media. Second it can be dragged by the user to seek to a different position. \nTo realize the first function C code will periodically call our setCurrentPosition method so we can update the position of the thumb in the Seek Bar. Again we do so from the UI thread using RunOnUiThread \nTo the left of the Seek Bar refer to the screenshot at the top of this page there is a TextView widget which we will use to display the current position and duration in HH mm ss HH mm ss textual format. The updateTimeWidget method takes care of it and must be called every time the Seek Bar is updated \n"});
