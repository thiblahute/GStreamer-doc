It invokes a file chooser dialog based on the Android File Dialog project that allows you to choose a local media file no matter what extension or MIME type it has. \nIf a new media is selected it is passed onto the native code which will set the pipeline to READY pass the URI onto playbin and bring the pipeline back to the previous state The current position is also reset so the new clip does not start in the previous position. \nWhile watching a movie there is typically no user activity. After a short period of such inactivity Android will dim the screen and then turn it off completely. To prevent this a Wake Lock is used. The application acquires the lock when the Play button is pressed so the screen is never turned off and releases it when the Pause button is pressed. \n"});
