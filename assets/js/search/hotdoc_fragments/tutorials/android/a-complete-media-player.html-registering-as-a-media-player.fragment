By specifying in the intent filter of the activity that it understands the audio video and image MIME types the tutorial will be offered as an option whenever an application requires such medias to be viewed. \nUnfortunately GStreamer knows more file formats than Android does so for some files Android will not provide a MIME type. For these cases a new intent filter has to be provided which ignores MIME types and focuses only in the filename extension. This is inconvenient because the list of extensions can be large but there does not seem to be another option. In this tutorial only a very short list of extensions is provided for simplicity. \nFinally GStreamer can also playback remote files so URI schemes like http are supported in another intent filter. Android does not provide MIME types for remote files so the filename extension list has to be provided again. \nOnce we have informed the system of our capabilities it will start sending Intents to invoke our activity which will contain the desired URI to play. In the onCreate method the intent that invoked the activity is retrieved and checked for such URI. \n"});
