Fortunately the VideoOverlay interface allows providing video sinks with an already created window onto which they can draw as we have seen in Basic tutorial GUI toolkit integration. \nIn this tutorial a SurfaceView widget actually a subclass of it is placed on the main layout. When Android informs the application that a surface has been created for this widget we pass it to the C code which stores it. The check_initialization_complete method explained in the previous tutorial is extended so that GStreamer is not considered initialized until a main loop is running and a drawing surface has been received. \n"});
