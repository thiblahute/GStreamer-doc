If the user is searching for a particular scene we do not want it to keep moving. \nonProgressChanged is called every time the thumb moves be it because the user dragged it or because we called setProgress on the Seek Bar. We discard the latter case with the handy fromUser parameter. \nAs the comment says if this is a local media we allow scrub seeking this is we jump to the indicated position as soon as the thumb moves. Otherwise the seek will be performed when the thumb is released and the only thing we do here is update the textual time widget. \nFinally onStopTrackingTouch is called when the thumb is released. We simply perform the seek operation if the file was non local and restore the pipeline to the desired playing state. \nThis concludes the User interface part of this tutorial. Let s review now the under the hood C code that allows this to work. \n"});
