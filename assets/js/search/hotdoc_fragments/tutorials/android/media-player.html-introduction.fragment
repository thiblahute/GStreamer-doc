The most complex part is assembling a pipeline which retrieves decodes and displays the media but we already know that the playbin element can take care of all that for us. We only need to replace the manual pipeline we used in Android tutorial Video with a single element playbin pipeline and we are good to go \nHowever we can do better than. We will add a Seek Bar with a moving thumb that will advance as our current position in the media advances. We will also allow the user to drag the thumb to jump or seek to a different position. \nAnd finally we will make the video surface adapt to the media size so the video sink is not forced to draw black borders around the clip. This also allows the Android layout to adapt more nicely to the actual media content. You can still force the video surface to have a specific size if you really want to. \n"});
