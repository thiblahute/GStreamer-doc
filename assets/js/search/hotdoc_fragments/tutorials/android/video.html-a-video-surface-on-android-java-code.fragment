Only the parts of the code that are new will be discussed. \nTwo new entry points to the C code are defined nativeSurfaceInit and nativeSurfaceFinalize which we will call when the video surface becomes available and when it is about to be destroyed respectively. \nIn onCreate we retrieve the SurfaceView and then register ourselves to receive notifications about the surface state through the SurfaceHolder interface. This is why we declared this Activity as implementing the SurfaceHolder.Callback interface in line \nThis interface is composed of the three methods above which get called when the geometry of the surface changes when the surface is created and when it is about to be destroyed. surfaceChanged always gets called at least once right after surfaceCreated so we will use it to notify GStreamer about the new surface. We use surfaceDestroyed to tell GStreamer to stop using this surface. \nLet s review the C code to see what these functions do. \n"});
