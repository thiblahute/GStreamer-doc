For simplicity this tutorial assumes that they do not. Therefore in the READY to PAUSED state change once the Caps of the decoded media are known we inspect them in check_media_size \nWe first retrieve the video sink element from the pipeline using the video sink property of playbin and then its sink Pad. The negotiated Caps of this Pad which we recover using gst_pad_get_current_caps are the Caps of the decoded media. \nThe helper functions gst_video_format_parse_caps and gst_video_parse_caps_pixel_aspect_ratio turn the Caps into manageable integers which we pass to the application through its mediaSizeChanged callback. \n"});
