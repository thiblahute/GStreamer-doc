Click here to expand \nVideoViewController.m \nSupporting arbitrary media URIs \nThe GStreamerBackend provides the setUri method so we can indicate the URI of the media to play. Since playbin will be taking care of retrieving the media we can use local or remote URIs indistinctly file or http for example From the UI code though we want to keep track of whether the file is local or remote because we will not offer the same functionalities. We keep track of this in the is_local_media variable which is set when the URI is set in the gstreamerInitialized method \nReporting media size \nEvery time the size of the media changes which could happen mid stream for some kind of streams or when it is first detected GStreamerBackend calls our mediaSizeChanged callback \nHere we simply store the new size and ask the layout to be recalculated. As we have already seen in iOS tutorial A running pipeline methods which change the UI must be called from the main thread and we are now in a callback from some GStreamer internal thread. Hence the usage of dispatch_async \n"});
