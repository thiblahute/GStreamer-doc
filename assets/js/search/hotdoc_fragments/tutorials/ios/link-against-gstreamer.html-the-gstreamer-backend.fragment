In successive tutorials it will get expanded but for now it only contains a method to retrieve the GStreamer version. \nThe GStreamerBackend is made in Objective C so it can take care of the few C to Objective C conversions that might be necessary like char to NSString for example This eases the usage of this class by the UI code which is typically made in pure Objective C. GStreamerBackend serves exactly the same purpose as the JNI code in the Android tutorials. \nGStreamerBackend.m \nThe getGStreamerVersion method simply calls gst_version_string to obtain a string describing this version of GStreamer. This Modified UTF8 string is then converted to a NSString by NSString stringWithUTF8Stringand returned. Objective C will take care of freeing the memory used by the new NSString but we need to free the char returned by gst_version_string \n"});
