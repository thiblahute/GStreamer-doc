This one simply adds a few finishing touches. In particular it adds the capability to choose the media to play and disables the screensaver during media playback. \nThese are not features directly related to GStreamer and are therefore outside the scope of these tutorials. Only a few implementation pointers are given here. \nA new UIView has been added derived from UITableViewController which shows a list of clips. When one is selected the VideoViewController from iOS tutorial A basic media player appears and its URI property is set to the URI of the selected clip. \nThe list of clips is populated from three sources Media from the device s Photo library Media from the application s Documents folder accessible through iTunes file sharing and a list of hardcoded Internet addresses selected to showcase different container and codec formats and a couple of bogus ones to illustrate error reporting. \nWhile watching a movie there is typically no user activity. After a short period of such inactivity iOS will dim the screen and then turn it off completely. To prevent this the idleTimerDisabled property of the UIApplication class is used. The application sets it to YES screen locking disabled when the Play button is pressed so the screen is never turned off and sets it back to NO when the Pause button is pressed. \nThis finishes the series of iOS tutorials. Each one of the preceding tutorials has evolved on top of the previous one showing how to implement a particular set of features and concluding in this Tutorial \nIt has been a pleasure having you here and see you soon \n"});
