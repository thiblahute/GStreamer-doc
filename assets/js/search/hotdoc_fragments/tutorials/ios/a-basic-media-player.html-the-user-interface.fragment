A UISlider has been added to the toolbar to keep track of the current position in the clip and allow the user to change it. Also a read only UITextField is added to show the exact clip position and duration. \nVideoViewController.h \nNote how we register callbacks for some of the Actions the UISlider generates. Also note that the class has been renamed from ViewController to VideoViewController since the next tutorial adds another ViewController and we will need to differentiate. \n"});
