Even though the tutorials will make sure that deep knowledge of these libraries is not required familiarity with them will certainly ease the process of learning GStreamer. \nYou can always tell which library you are calling because all GStreamer functions structures and types have the gst_ prefix whereas GLib and GObject use g_. \n"});
