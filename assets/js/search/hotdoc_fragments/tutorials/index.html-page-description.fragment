If you have not done so yet go to the installing GStreamer page and come back here afterwards. \nThe tutorials are currently written only in the C programming language so you need to be comfortable with it. Even though C is not an Object Oriented OO language per se the GStreamer framework uses GObjects so some knowledge of OO concepts will come in handy. Knowledge of the GObject and GLib libraries is not mandatory but will make the trip easier. \nEvery tutorial represents a self contained project with full source code in C and eventually in other languages too Source code snippets are introduced alongside the text and the full code with any other required files like makefiles or project files is distributed with GStreamer as explained in the installation instructions. \nGStreamer is built on top of the GObject for object orientation and GLib for common algorithms libraries which means that every now and then you will have to call functions of these libraries. Even though the tutorials will make sure that deep knowledge of these libraries is not required familiarity with them will certainly ease the process of learning GStreamer. \nYou can always tell which library you are calling because all GStreamer functions structures and types have the gst_ prefix whereas GLib and GObject use g_. \nYou have the GObject and GLib reference guides and of course the upstream GStreamer documentation. \nThe tutorials are organized in sections revolving about a common theme \nIf you cannot remember in which tutorial a certain GStreamer concept is explained use the following \nThe audio and video clips used throughout these tutorials are all publicly available and the copyright remains with their respective authors. In some cases they have been re encoded for demonstration purposes. \n"});
