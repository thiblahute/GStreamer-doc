A playbin pipeline is instantiated and set to run and a keyboard watch is installed so keystrokes can be monitored. \nThis method prints the current value for all channels and exemplifies how to retrieve the list of channels. This is accomplished through the gst_color_balance_list_channels method. It returns a GList which needs to be traversed. \nEach element in the list is a GstColorBalanceChannel structure informing of the channel s name minimum value and maximum value. gst_color_balance_get_value can then be called on each channel to retrieve the current value. \nIn this example the minimum and maximum values are used to output the current value as a percentage. \nThis method locates the specified channel by name and increases or decreases it as requested. Again the list of channels is retrieved and parsed looking for the channel with the specified name. Obviously this list could be parsed only once and the pointers to the channels be stored and indexed by something more efficient than a string. \nThe current value for the channel is then retrieved changed the increment is proportional to its dynamic range clamped to avoid out of range values and set using gst_color_balance_set_value \nAnd there is not much more to it. Run the program and observe the effect of changing each of the channels in real time. \n"});
