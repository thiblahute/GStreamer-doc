This is convenient because the audio signal then travels from the computer to the speakers in a form that is more resilient to interference and noise resulting higher quality. \nThe connection is typically made through an S PDIF cable which can either be optical with TOSLINK connectors or coaxial with RCA connectors S PDIF is also known as IEC type II IEC before \nIn this scenario GStreamer does not need to perform audio decoding it can simply output the encoded data acting in pass through mode and let the external audio system perform the decoding. \n"});
