If any of the elements in the playbin pipeline support this interface playbin simply forwards it to the application otherwise a colorbalance element is inserted in the pipeline. \nThis interface allows querying for the available color balance channels GstColorBalanceChannel along with their name and valid range of values and then modify the current value of any of them. \n"});
