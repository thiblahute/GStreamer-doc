Just set the appropriate playbin flag and when an audio only stream is found it will instantiate the necessary elements to create and display the visualization. \nIf you want to specify the actual element that you want to use to generate the visualization you instantiate it yourself and then tell playbin about it through the vis plugin property. \nThis tutorial searches the GStreamer registry for all the elements of the Visualization class tries to select goom or another one if it is not available and passes it to playbin. \n"});
