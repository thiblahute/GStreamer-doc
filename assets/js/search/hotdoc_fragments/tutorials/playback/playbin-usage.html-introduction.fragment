The most common case are regular movies which contain one video and one audio stream Stereo or audio tracks are considered a single stream It is also increasingly common to find movies with one video and multiple audio streams to account for different languages. In this case the user selects one audio stream and the application will only play that one ignoring the others. \nTo be able to select the appropriate stream the user needs to know certain information about them for example their language. This information is embedded in the streams in the form of metadata annexed data and this tutorial shows how to retrieve it. \nSubtitles can also be embedded in a file along with audio and video but they are dealt with in more detail in Playback tutorial Subtitle management. Finally multiple video streams can also be found in a single file for example in DVD with multiple angles of the same scene but they are somewhat rare. \nEmbedding multiple streams inside a single file is called multiplexing or muxing and such file is then known as a container Common container formats are Matroska mkv Quicktime qt mov mp4 Ogg ogg or Webm webm \n"});
