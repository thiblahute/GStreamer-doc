This is so because there is no mechanism to query an external audio decoder which formats are supported and in fact the cable can even be disconnected during this process. \nFor example after enabling Digital Audio Output in the system s Control Panel directsoundsink will automatically expose audio x ac3 audio x eac3 and audio x dts caps in addition to audio x raw. However one particular external decoder might only understand raw integer streams and would try to play the compressed data as such a painful experience for your ears rest assured \nSolving this issue requires user intervention since only the user knows the formats supported by the external decoder. \nOn some systems the simplest solution is to inform the operating system of the formats that the external audio decoder can accept. In this way the GStreamer audio sinks will only offer these formats. The acceptable audio formats are commonly selected from the operating system s audio configuration panel from the same place where Digital Audio Output is enabled but unfortunately this option is not available in all audio drivers. \nAnother solution involves using a custom sinkbin see Playback tutorial Custom playbin sinks which includes a capsfilter element see Basic tutorial Handy elements and an audio sink. The caps that the external decoder supports are then set in the capsfiler so the wrong format is not output. This allows the application to enforce the appropriate format instead of relying on the user to have the system correctly configured. Still requires user intervention but can be used regardless of the options the audio driver offers. \nPlease do not use autoaudiosink as the audio sink as it currently only supports raw audio and will ignore any compressed format. \n"});
