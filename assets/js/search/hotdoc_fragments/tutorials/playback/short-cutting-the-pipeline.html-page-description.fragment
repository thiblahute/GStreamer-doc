To connect an appsink to playbin see Playback tutorial Custom playbin sinks. This tutorial shows \nCopy this code into a text file named playback tutorial c. \nplayback tutorial c \nTo use an appsrc as the source for the pipeline simply instantiate a playbin and set its URI to appsrc \nplaybin will create an internal appsrc element and fire the source setup signal to allow the application to configure it \nIn particular it is important to set the caps property of appsrc since once the signal handler returns playbin will instantiate the next element in the pipeline according to these caps \nThe configuration of the appsrc is exactly the same as in Basic tutorial Short cutting the pipeline the caps are set to audio x raw and two callbacks are registered so the element can tell the application when it needs to start and stop pushing data. See Basic tutorial Short cutting the pipeline for more details. \nFrom this point onwards playbin takes care of the rest of the pipeline and the application only needs to worry about generating more data when told so. \nTo learn how data can be extracted from playbin using the appsink element see Playback tutorial Custom playbin sinks. \nThis tutorial applies the concepts shown in Basic tutorial Short cutting the pipeline to playbin. In particular it has shown \nIt has been a pleasure having you here and see you soon \n"});
