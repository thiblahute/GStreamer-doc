fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "tutorials/playback/subtitle-management.html#walkthrough", "fragment": "Walkthrough \nThis tutorial is copied from Playback tutorial Playbin usage with some changes so let s review only the changes. \nAfter setting the media URI we set the suburi property which points playbin to a file containing a subtitle stream. In this case the media file already contains multiple subtitle streams so the one provided in the suburi is added to the list and will be the currently selected one. \nNote that metadata concerning a subtitle stream like its language resides in the container file therefore subtitles not embedded in a container will not have metadata. When running this tutorial you will find that the first subtitle stream does not have a language tag. \nThe subtitle font desc property allows specifying the font to render the subtitles. Since Pango is the library used to render fonts you can check its documentation to see how this font should be specified in particular the pango font description from string function. \nIn a nutshell the format of the string representation is FAMILY LIST STYLE OPTIONS SIZE where FAMILY LIST is a comma separated list of families optionally terminated by a comma STYLE_OPTIONS is a whitespace separated list of words where each word describes one of style variant weight or stretch and SIZE is an decimal number size in points For example the following are all valid string representations \nThe commonly available font families are Normal Sans Serif and Monospace. \nThe available styles are Normal the font is upright Oblique the font is slanted but in a roman style Italic the font is slanted in an italic style \nThe available weights are Ultra Light Light Normal Bold Ultra Bold Heavy. \nThe available variants are Normal Small_Caps A font with the lower case characters replaced by smaller variants of the capital characters \nThe available stretch styles are Ultra Condensed Extra Condensed Condensed Semi Condensed Normal Semi Expanded Expanded Extra Expanded Ultra Expanded \nWe set the flags property to allow Audio Video and Text Subtitles \nThe rest of the tutorial is the same as Playback tutorial Playbin usage except that the keyboard input changes the current text property instead of the current audio. As before keep in mind that stream changes are not immediate since there is a lot of information flowing through the pipeline that needs to reach the end of it before the new stream shows up. \n"});
