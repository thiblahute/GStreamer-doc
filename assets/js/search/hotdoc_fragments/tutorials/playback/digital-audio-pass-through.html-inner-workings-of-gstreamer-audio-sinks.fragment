The method to achieve this depend on the operating system but it generally involves going to the audio control panel and activating a checkbox reading Digital Audio Output or similar. \nThe main GStreamer audio sinks for each platform Pulse Audio pulsesink for Linux osxaudiosink for OS X and Direct Sound directsoundsink for Windows detect when digital audio output is available and change their input caps accordingly to accept encoded data. For example these elements typically accept audio x raw data when digital audio output is enabled in the system they may also accept audio mpeg audio x ac3 audio x eac3 or audio x dts. \nThen when playbin builds the decoding pipeline it realizes that the audio sink can be directly connected to the encoded data typically coming out of a demuxer so there is no need for a decoder. This process is automatic and does not need any action from the application. \nOn Linux there exist other audio sinks like Alsa alsasink which work differently a digital device needs to be manually selected through the device property of the sink Pulse Audio though is the commonly preferred audio sink on Linux. \n"});
