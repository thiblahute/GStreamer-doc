Fortunately modern graphics cards equipped with programmable GPUs are able to take care of this job allowing the CPU to concentrate on other duties. Having dedicated hardware becomes essential for low power CPUs which are simply incapable of decoding such media fast enough. \nIn the current state of things June each GPU manufacturer offers a different method to access their hardware a different API and a strong industry standard has not emerged yet. \nAs of June there exist at least different video decoding acceleration APIs \nVAAPI Video Acceleration API Initially designed by Intel in targeted at the X Window System on Unix based operating systems now open source. It now also supports Wayland through dmabuf. It is currently not limited to Intel GPUs as other manufacturers are free to use this API for example Imagination Technologies or S3 Graphics. Accessible to GStreamer through the gstreamer vaapi package. \nVDPAU Video Decode and Presentation API for UNIX Initially designed by NVidia in targeted at the X Window System on Unix based operating systems now open source. Although it is also an open source library no manufacturer other than NVidia is using it yet. Accessible to GStreamer through the vdpau element in plugins bad. \nOpenMAX Open Media Acceleration Managed by the non profit technology consortium Khronos Group it is a royalty free cross platform set of C language programming interfaces that provides abstractions for routines especially useful for audio video and still images Accessible to GStreamer through the gst omx plugin. \nOVD Open Video Decode Another API from AMD Graphics designed to be a platform agnostic method for softrware developers to leverage the Universal Video Decode UVD hardware inside AMD Radeon graphics cards. Currently unavailable to GStreamer \nDCE Distributed Codec Engine An open source software library libdce and API specification by Texas Instruments targeted at Linux systems and ARM platforms. Accessible to GStreamer through the gstreamer ducati plugin. \nAndroid MediaCodec This is Android s API to access the device s hardware decoder and encoder if available. This is accessible through the androidmedia plugin in gst plugins bad. This includes both encoding and decoding. \nApple VideoTool Box Framework Apple s API to access h is available through the applemedia plugin which includes both encoding through the vtenc element and decoding through the vtdec element. \nVideo4Linux Recent Linux kernels have a kernel API to expose hardware codecs in a standard way this is now supported by the v4l2 plugin in gst plugins good. This can support both decoding and encoding depending on the platform. \n"});
