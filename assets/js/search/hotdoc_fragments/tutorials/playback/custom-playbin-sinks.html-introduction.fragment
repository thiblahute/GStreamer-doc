If a more complex pipeline is required for example an equalizer plus an audio sink it needs to be wrapped in a Bin so it looks to playbin as if it was a single Element. \nA Bin GstBin is a container that encapsulates partial pipelines so they can be managed as single elements. As an example the GstPipeline we have been using in all tutorials is a type of GstBin which does not interact with external Elements. Elements inside a Bin connect to external elements through Ghost Pads GstGhostPad this is Pads on the surface of the Bin which simply forward data from an external Pad to a given Pad on an internal Element. \n\nFigure A Bin with two Elements and one Ghost Pad. \nGstBins are also a type of GstElement so they can be used wherever an Element is required in particular as sinks for playbin and they are then known as sink bins \n"});
