The name if the tags is standardized and the list can be found in the GstTagList documentation. In this example we are interested in the GST_TAG_LANGUAGE_CODE of the streams and their GST_TAG_ _CODEC audio video or text \nOnce we have extracted all the metadata we want we get the streams that are currently selected through more properties of playbin current video current audio and current text. \nIt is interesting to always check the currently selected streams and never make any assumption. Multiple internal conditions can make playbin behave differently in different executions. Also the order in which the streams are listed can change from one run to another so checking the metadata to identify one particular stream becomes crucial. \nFinally we allow the user to switch the running audio stream. This very basic function just reads a string from the standard input the keyboard interprets it as a number and tries to set the current audio property of playbin which previously we have only read \nBear in mind that the switch is not immediate. Some of the previously decoded audio will still be flowing through the pipeline while the new stream becomes active and is decoded. The delay depends on the particular multiplexing of the streams in the container and the length playbin has selected for its internal queues which depends on the network conditions \nIf you execute the tutorial you will be able to switch from one language to another while the movie is running by pressing or and ENTER This concludes this tutorial. \n"});
