If you have not done so yet go to the installing GStreamer page and come back here afterwards. \nThe tutorials are currently written only in the C programming language so you need to be comfortable with it. Even though C is not an Object Oriented OO language per se the GStreamer framework uses GObjects so some knowledge of OO concepts will come in handy. Knowledge of the GObject and GLib libraries is not mandatory but will make the trip easier. \n"});
