The reason for this choice in licensing is to ensure that everyone can use GStreamer to build applications using licenses of their choice. \nTo keep this policy viable the GStreamer community has made a few licensing rules for code to be included in GStreamer s core or GStreamer s official modules like our plugin packages. We require that all code going into our core packages is LGPL. For the plugin code we require the use of the LGPL for all plugins written from scratch or linking to external libraries. The only exception to this is when plugins contain older code under the BSD and MIT license. They can use those licenses instead and will still be considered for inclusion we do prefer that all new code written though is at least dual licensed LGPL. We do not accept GPL code to be added to our plugins modules but we do accept LGPL licensed plugins using an external GPL library for some of our plugin modules. The reason we demand plugins be licensed under the LGPL even when they are using a GPL library is that other developers might want to use the plugin code as a template for plugins linking to non GPL libraries. We also accept dual licensed plugins for inclusion as long as one of the licenses offered for dual licensing is the LGPL. \nWe also do not allow plugins under any license into our core base or good packages if they have known patent issues associated with them. This means that even a contributed LGPL MIT licensed implementation of something which there is a licensing body claiming fees for those plugins would need to go into our gst plugins ugly module. \nAll new plugins regardless of licensing or patents tend to have to go through a period in our incubation module gst plugins bad before moving to ugly base or good. \n"});
