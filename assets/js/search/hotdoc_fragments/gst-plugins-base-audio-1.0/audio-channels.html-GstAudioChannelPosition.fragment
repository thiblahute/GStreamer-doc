In the caps the actual channel layout is expressed with a channel count and a channel mask which describes the existing channels. The positions in the bit mask correspond to the enum values. For negotiation it is allowed to have more bits set in the channel mask than the number of channels to specify the allowed channel positions but this is not allowed in negotiated caps. It is not allowed in any situation other than the one mentioned below to have less bits set in the channel mask than the number of channels. \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_MONO can only be used with a single mono channel that has no direction information and would be mixed into all directional channels. This is expressed in caps by having a single channel and no channel mask. \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE can only be used if all channels have this position. This is expressed in caps by having a channel mask with no bits set. \nAs another special case it is allowed to have two channels without a channel mask. This implicitely means that this is a stereo stream with a front left and front right channel. \nAudio channel positions. \nThese are the channels defined in SMPTE Table for audio systems with the Surround and Wide channels from DTS Coherent Acoustics v.1.3.1 and and layouts.
