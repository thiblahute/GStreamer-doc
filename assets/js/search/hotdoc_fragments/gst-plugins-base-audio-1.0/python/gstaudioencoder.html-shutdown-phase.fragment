The pads need to be named sink and src It also needs to set the fixed caps on srcpad when the format is ensured. This is typically when base class calls subclass set_format function though it might be delayed until calling gst_audio_encoder_finish_frame. \nIn summary above process should have subclass concentrating on codec data processing while leaving other matters to base class such as most notably timestamp handling. While it may exert more control in this area see e.g. pre_push it is very much not recommended. \nIn particular base class will either favor tracking upstream timestamps at the possible expense of jitter or aim to arrange for a perfect stream of output timestamps depending on perfect timestamp. However in the latter case the input may not be so perfect or ideal which is handled as follows. An input timestamp is compared with the expected timestamp as dictated by input sample stream and if the deviation is less than tolerance the deviation is discarded. Otherwise it is considered a discontuinity and subsequent output timestamp is resynced to the new position after performing configured discontinuity processing. In the non perfect timestamp case an upstream variation exceeding tolerance only leads to marking DISCONT on subsequent outgoing while timestamps are adjusted to upstream regardless of variation While DISCONT is also marked in the perfect timestamp case this one optionally see hard resync performs some additional steps such as clipping of early input samples or draining all currently remaining input data depending on the direction of the discontuinity. \nIf perfect timestamps are arranged it is also possible to request baseclass usually set by subclass to provide additional buffer metadata in OFFSET and OFFSET_END fields according to granule defined semantics currently needed by oggmux. Specifically OFFSET is set to granulepos sample count including buffer and OFFSET_END to corresponding timestamp as determined by same sample count and sample rate \nThings that subclass need to take care of \n"});
