Also elements deriving from GstAudio.AudioFilter may use GstAudio.AudioFilterClass.add_pad_templates from their class_init function to easily configure the set of caps formats that the element is able to handle. \nDerived classes should override the GstAudioFilterClass.setup and GstBaseTransformClass.transform_ip not introspectable and or GstBaseTransformClass.transform not introspectable virtual functions in their class_init function. \n"});
