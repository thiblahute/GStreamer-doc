Also elements deriving from Gst.Audio.AudioFilter may use Gst.Audio.AudioFilter.AddAudioPadTemplate from their class_init function to easily configure the set of caps formats that the element is able to handle. \nDerived classes should override the Setup and TransformIp and or Transform virtual functions in their class_init function. \n"});
