Also elements deriving from GstAudio.AudioFilter may use GstAudio.AudioFilterClass.prototype.add_pad_templates from their class_init function to easily configure the set of caps formats that the element is able to handle. \nDerived classes should override the do_setup and GstBaseTransform transform_ip and or GstBaseTransform transform virtual functions in their class_init function. \n"});
