Subclass should setup for encoding and configure various base class parameters appropriately notably those directing desired input data handling. While unlikely it might be called more than once if changing input parameters require reconfiguration. \nGstAudioEncoder calls stop at end of all processing. \nAs of configuration stage and throughout processing GstAudioEncoder maintains various parameters that provide required context e.g. describing the format of input audio data. Conversely subclass can and should configure these context parameters to inform base class of its expectation w.r.t. buffer handling. \n"});
