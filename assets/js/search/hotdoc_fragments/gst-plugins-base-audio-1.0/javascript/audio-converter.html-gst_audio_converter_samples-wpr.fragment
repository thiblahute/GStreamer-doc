Use GstAudio.AudioConverter.prototype.get_out_frames and GstAudio.AudioConverter.prototype.get_in_frames to make sure in_frames and out_frames are matching and in and out point to enough memory. \nParameters \na GstAudio.AudioConverter \nextra GstAudio.AudioConverterFlags \ninput frames \nnumber of input frames \noutput frames \nnumber of output frames \ntrue is the conversion could be performed. \n"});
