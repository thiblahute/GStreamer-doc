Use GstAudio.AudioResampler.prototype.get_out_frames and GstAudio.AudioResampler.prototype.get_in_frames to make sure in_frames and out_frames are matching and in and out point to enough memory. \nReset resampler to the state it was when it was first created discarding all sample history. \nUpdate the resampler parameters for resampler. This function should not be called concurrently with any other function on resampler. \nWhen in_rate or out_rate is its value is unchanged. \nWhen options is null the previously configured options are reused. \nMake a new resampler. \nSet the parameters for resampling from in_rate to out_rate using method for quality in options. \nThe different filter interpolation methods. \nno interpolation \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerFilterInterpolation.prototype.linear \nlinear interpolation of the filter coeficients. \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerFilterInterpolation.prototype.cubic \ncubic interpolation of the filter coeficients. \nSelect for the filter tables should be set up. \nUse interpolated filter tables. This uses less memory but more CPU and is slightly less accurate but it allows for more efficient variable rate resampling with GstAudio.AudioResampler.prototype.update. \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerFilterMode.prototype.full \nUse full filter table. This uses more memory but less CPU. \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerFilterMode.prototype.auto \nAutomatically choose between interpolated and full filter tables. \nDifferent resampler flags. \ninput samples are non interleaved. an array of blocks of samples one for each channel should be passed to the resample function. \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerFlags.prototype.non_interleaved_out \noutput samples are non interleaved. an array of blocks of samples one for each channel should be passed to the resample function. \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerFlags.prototype.variable_rate \noptimize for dynamic updates of the sample rates with GstAudio.AudioResampler.prototype.update. This will select an interpolating filter when GstAudio.AudioResamplerFilterMode.prototype.auto is configured. \nDifferent subsampling and upsampling methods \nDuplicates the samples when upsampling and drops when downsampling \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerMethod.prototype.linear \nUses linear interpolation to reconstruct missing samples and averaging to downsample \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerMethod.prototype.cubic \nUses cubic interpolation \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerMethod.prototype.blackman_nuttall \nUses Blackman Nuttall windowed sinc interpolation \nGstAudio.AudioResamplerMethod.prototype.kaiser \nUses Kaiser windowed sinc interpolation \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE Cutoff parameter for the filter. is the default. \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE transition bandwidth. The width of the transition band for the kaiser window. is the default. \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE B parameter of the cubic filter. Values between and are accepted. is the default. \nBelow are some values of popular filters B C Hermite Spline Catmull Rom \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE C parameter of the cubic filter. Values between and are accepted. is the default. \nSee GstAudio.AUDIO_RESAMPLER_OPT_CUBIC_B for some more common values \nG_TYPE_INT the number of taps to use for the filter. is the default and selects the taps automatically. \nGST_TYPE_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_MODE how the filter tables should be constructed. GST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_MODE_AUTO is the default. \nG_TYPE_UINT the amount of memory to use for full filter tables before switching to interpolated filter tables. is the default. \nGST_TYPE_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_INTERPOLATION how the filter coeficients should be interpolated. GST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_INTERPOLATION_CUBIC is default. \nG_TYPE_UINT oversampling to use when interpolating filters is the default. \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE The maximum allowed phase error when switching sample rates. is the default. \n"});
