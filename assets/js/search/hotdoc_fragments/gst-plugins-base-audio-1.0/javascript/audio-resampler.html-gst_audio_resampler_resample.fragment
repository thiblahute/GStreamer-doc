Use GstAudio.AudioResampler.prototype.get_out_frames and GstAudio.AudioResampler.prototype.get_in_frames to make sure in_frames and out_frames are matching and in and out point to enough memory. \nParameters \na GstAudio.AudioResampler \ninput samples \nnumber of input frames \noutput samples \nnumber of output frames \n"});
