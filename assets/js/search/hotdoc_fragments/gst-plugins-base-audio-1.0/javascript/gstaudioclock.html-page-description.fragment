Whenever the clock time should be calculated it will call func with user_data. When func returns Gst.CLOCK_TIME_NONE the clock will return the last reported time. \nAdjust time with the internal offset of the audio clock. \nReport the time as returned by the GstAudio.AudioClockGetTimeFunc without applying any offsets. \nInvalidate the clock function. Call this function when the provided GstAudio.AudioClockGetTimeFunc cannot be called anymore for example when the user_data becomes invalid. \nAfter calling this function clock will return the last returned time for the rest of its lifetime. \nInform clock that future calls to GstAudio.AudioClockGetTimeFunc will return values starting from time. The clock will update an internal offset to make sure that future calls to internal_time will return an increasing result as required by the Gst.Clock object. \ngpointer _gst_reserved \n"});
