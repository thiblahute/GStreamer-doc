For negative rates out_samples must be negative and in_samples positive. \nWhen out_samples is positive the first sample will be written at position sample in the ringbuffer. When out_samples is negative the last sample will be written to sample in reverse order. \nout_samples does not need to be a multiple of the segment size of the ringbuffer although it is recommended for optimal performance. \naccum will hold a temporary accumulator used in rate conversion and should be set to when this function is first called. In case the commit operation is interrupted one can resume the processing by passing the previously returned accum value back to this function. \nMT safe. \nParameters \nthe GstAudio.AudioRingBuffer to commit \nthe sample position of the data \nthe data to commit \nthe number of samples in the data to commit \nthe number of samples to write to the ringbuffer \naccumulator for rate conversion. \nThe number of samples written to the ringbuffer or on error. The number of samples written can be less than out_samples when buf was interrupted with a flush or stop. \n"});
