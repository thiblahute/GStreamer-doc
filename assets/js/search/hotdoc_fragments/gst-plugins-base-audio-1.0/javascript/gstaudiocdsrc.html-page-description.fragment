Applications will usually only find the track format interesting. You can retrieve that Gst.Format for use in seek events or queries with gst_format_get_by_nick track \nIn order to query the number of tracks for example an application would set the CDDA source element to READY or PAUSED state and then query the the number of tracks via Gst.Element.prototype.query_duration using the track format acquired above. Applications can query the currently playing track in the same way. \nAlternatively applications may retrieve the currently playing track and the total number of tracks from the taglist that will posted on the bus whenever the CD is opened or the currently playing track changes. The taglist will contain GST_TAG_TRACK_NUMBER and GST_TAG_TRACK_COUNT tags. \nApplications playing back CD audio using playbin and cdda n URIs should issue a seek command in track format to change between tracks rather than setting a new cdda n URI on playbin as setting a new URI on playbin involves closing and re opening the CD device which is much much slower \nApplications will be informed of the available tracks via a TOC message on the pipeline s Gst.Bus. The Gst.Toc will contain a Gst.TocEntry for each track with information about each track. The duration for each track can be retrieved via the Gst.TAG_DURATION tag from each entry s tag list or calculated via Gst.TocEntry.prototype.get_start_stop_times. The track entries in the TOC will be sorted by track number. \n"});
