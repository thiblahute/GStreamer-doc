Examples for such elements are volume not introspectable and playbin not introspectable \nApplications can use this interface to get or set the current stream volume. For this the volume GLib.Object property can be used or the helper functions Gst.Audio.IStreamVolume.SetVolume and Gst.Audio.IStreamVolume.GetVolume. This volume is always a linear factor i.e. is muted is For showing the volume in a GUI it might make sense to convert it to a different format by using Gst.Audio.Global.StreamVolumeConvertVolume. Volume sliders should usually use a cubic volume. \nSeparate from the volume the stream can also be muted by the mute GLib.Object property or Gst.Audio.IStreamVolume.SetMute and Gst.Audio.IStreamVolume.GetMute. \nElements that provide some kind of stream volume should implement the volume and mute GLib.Object properties and handle setting and getting of them properly. The volume property is defined to be a linear volume factor. \n"});
