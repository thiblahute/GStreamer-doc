This uses less memory but more CPU and is slightly less accurate but it allows for more efficient variable rate resampling with gst_audio_resampler_update. \nGST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_MODE_FULL \nUse full filter table. This uses more memory but less CPU. \nGST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_MODE_AUTO \nAutomatically choose between interpolated and full filter tables. \ninput samples are non interleaved. an array of blocks of samples one for each channel should be passed to the resample function. \nGST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FLAG_NON_INTERLEAVED_OUT \noutput samples are non interleaved. an array of blocks of samples one for each channel should be passed to the resample function. \nGST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FLAG_VARIABLE_RATE \noptimize for dynamic updates of the sample rates with gst_audio_resampler_update. This will select an interpolating filter when GST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_MODE_AUTO is configured. \nDuplicates the samples when upsampling and drops when downsampling \nGST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_METHOD_LINEAR \nUses linear interpolation to reconstruct missing samples and averaging to downsample \nGST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_METHOD_CUBIC \nUses cubic interpolation \nGST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_METHOD_BLACKMAN_NUTTALL \nUses Blackman Nuttall windowed sinc interpolation \nGST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_METHOD_KAISER \nUses Kaiser windowed sinc interpolation \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE Cutoff parameter for the filter. is the default. \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE transition bandwidth. The width of the transition band for the kaiser window. is the default. \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE B parameter of the cubic filter. Values between and are accepted. is the default. \nBelow are some values of popular filters B C Hermite Spline Catmull Rom \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE C parameter of the cubic filter. Values between and are accepted. is the default. \nSee GST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_OPT_CUBIC_B for some more common values \nG_TYPE_INT the number of taps to use for the filter. is the default and selects the taps automatically. \nGST_TYPE_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_MODE how the filter tables should be constructed. GST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_MODE_AUTO is the default. \nG_TYPE_UINT the amount of memory to use for full filter tables before switching to interpolated filter tables. is the default. \nGST_TYPE_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_INTERPOLATION how the filter coeficients should be interpolated. GST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_FILTER_INTERPOLATION_CUBIC is default. \nG_TYPE_UINT oversampling to use when interpolating filters is the default. \nG_TYPE_DOUBLE The maximum allowed phase error when switching sample rates. is the default. \n"});
