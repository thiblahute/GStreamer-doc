This function fills in the data pointer of the ring buffer with a valid GstBuffer to which samples can be written. \nActivate buf to start or stop pulling data. \nMT safe. \nSubclasses should call this function to notify the fact that advance segments are now processed by the device. \nMT safe. \nFill the ringbuffer with silence. \nMT safe. \nClose the audio device associated with the ring buffer. The ring buffer should already have been released via gst_audio_ring_buffer_release. \nConvert src_val in src_fmt to the equivalent value in dest_fmt. The result will be put in dest_val. \nChecks the status of the device associated with the ring buffer. \nCheck if the ringbuffer is acquired and ready to use. \nCheck if buf is activated. \nMT safe. \nCheck if buf is flushing. \nMT safe. \nTell the ringbuffer that it is allowed to start playback when the ringbuffer is filled with samples. \nMT safe. \nOpen the audio device associated with the ring buffer. Does not perform any setup on the device. You must open the device before acquiring the ring buffer. \nReturns a pointer to memory where the data from segment segment can be found. This function is mostly used by subclasses. \nFree the resources of the ringbuffer. \nGet the number of samples that were processed by the ringbuffer since it was last started. This does not include the number of samples not yet processed see gst_audio_ring_buffer_delay \nSets the given callback function on the buffer. This function will be called every time a segment has been written to a device. \nMT safe. \nSets the given callback function on the buffer. This function will be called every time a segment has been written to a device. \nMT safe. \nTell the ringbuffer about the device s channel positions. This must be called in when the ringbuffer is acquired. \nSet the ringbuffer to flushing mode or normal mode. \nMT safe. \nMake sure that the next sample written to the device is accounted for as being the sample sample written to the device. This value will be used in reporting the current sample position of the ringbuffer. \nThis function will also clear the buffer with silence. \nMT safe. \nThe vmethods that subclasses can override to implement the ringbuffer. \ngpointer _gst_reserved \nguint64 buffer_time \nthe total buffer size in microseconds \ngint segsize \nthe size of one segment in bytes \ngint segtotal \nthe total number of segments \ngint seglatency \nnumber of segments queued in the lower level device defaults to segtotal \ngpointer _gst_reserved \nThe format of the samples in the ringbuffer. \nsamples in linear or float \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_MU_LAW \nsamples in mulaw \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_A_LAW \nsamples in alaw \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_IMA_ADPCM \nsamples in ima adpcm \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_MPEG \nsamples in mpeg audio but not AAC format \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_GSM \nsamples in gsm format \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_IEC958 \nsamples in IEC958 frames e.g. AC3 \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_AC3 \nsamples in AC3 format \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_EAC3 \nsamples in EAC3 format \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_DTS \nsamples in DTS format \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_MPEG2_AAC \nsamples in MPEG AAC ADTS format \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_MPEG4_AAC \nsamples in MPEG AAC ADTS format \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_MPEG2_AAC_RAW \nsamples in MPEG AAC raw format Since \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_MPEG4_AAC_RAW \nsamples in MPEG AAC raw format Since \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_FORMAT_TYPE_FLAC \nsamples in FLAC format Since \nThe ringbuffer is stopped \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_STATE_PAUSED \nThe ringbuffer is paused \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_STATE_STARTED \nThe ringbuffer is started \nGST_AUDIO_RING_BUFFER_STATE_ERROR \nThe ringbuffer has encountered an error after it has been started e.g. because the device was disconnected Since \n"});
