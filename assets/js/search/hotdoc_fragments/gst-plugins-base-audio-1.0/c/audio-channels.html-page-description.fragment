A partially valid channel_mask with less bits set than the number of channels is considered valid. \nConvert the position array of channels channels to a bitmask. \nIf force_order is TRUE it additionally checks if the channels are in the order required by GStreamer. \nConverts position to a human readable string representation for debugging purposes. \nReorders the channel positions in position from any order to the GStreamer channel order. \nChecks if position contains valid channel positions for channels channels. If force_order is TRUE it additionally checks if the channels are in the order required by GStreamer. \nReturns a reorder map for from to to that can be used in custom channel reordering code e.g. to convert from or to the GStreamer channel order. from and to must contain the same number of positions and the same positions only in a different order. \nThe resulting reorder_map can be used for reordering by assigning channel i of the input to channel reorder_map i of the output. \nused for position less channels e.g. from a sound card that records channels mutually exclusive with any other channel position \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_MONO \nMono without direction can only be used with channel \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_INVALID \ninvalid position \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_FRONT_LEFT \nFront left \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_FRONT_RIGHT \nFront right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_FRONT_CENTER \nFront center \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_LFE1 \nLow frequency effects subwoofer \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_REAR_LEFT \nRear left \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_REAR_RIGHT \nRear right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_FRONT_LEFT_OF_CENTER \nFront left of center \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_FRONT_RIGHT_OF_CENTER \nFront right of center \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_REAR_CENTER \nRear center \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_LFE2 \nLow frequency effects subwoofer \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_SIDE_LEFT \nSide left \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_SIDE_RIGHT \nSide right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_FRONT_LEFT \nTop front left \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_FRONT_RIGHT \nTop front right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_FRONT_CENTER \nTop front center \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_CENTER \nTop center \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_REAR_LEFT \nTop rear left \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_REAR_RIGHT \nTop rear right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_SIDE_LEFT \nTop side right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_SIDE_RIGHT \nTop rear right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_TOP_REAR_CENTER \nTop rear center \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_BOTTOM_FRONT_CENTER \nBottom front center \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_BOTTOM_FRONT_LEFT \nBottom front left \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_BOTTOM_FRONT_RIGHT \nBottom front right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_WIDE_LEFT \nWide left between front left and side left \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_WIDE_RIGHT \nWide right between front right and side right \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_SURROUND_LEFT \nSurround left between rear left and side left \nGST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_SURROUND_RIGHT \nSurround right between rear right and side right \n"});
