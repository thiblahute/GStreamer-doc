The pads need to be named sink and src It also needs to set the fixed caps on srcpad when the format is ensured. This is typically when base class calls subclass set_format function though it might be delayed until calling gst_audio_decoder_finish_frame. \nIn summary above process should have subclass concentrating on codec data processing while leaving other matters to base class such as most notably timestamp handling. While it may exert more control in this area see e.g. pre_push it is very much not recommended. \nIn particular base class will try to arrange for perfect output timestamps as much as possible while tracking upstream timestamps. To this end if deviation between the next ideal expected perfect timestamp and upstream exceeds GstAudioDecoder tolerance then resync to upstream occurs which would happen always if the tolerance mechanism is disabled \nIn non live pipelines baseclass can also configurably arrange for output buffer aggregation which may help to redue large r numbers of small er buffers being pushed and processed downstream. \nOn the other hand it should be noted that baseclass only provides limited seeking support upon explicit subclass request as full fledged support should rather be left to upstream demuxer parser or alike. This simple approach caters for seeking and duration reporting using estimated input bitrates. \nThings that subclass need to take care of \nProvide pad templates \nSet source pad caps when appropriate \nSet user configurable properties to sane defaults for format and implementing codec at hand and convey some subclass capabilities and expectations in context. \nAccept data in handle_frame and provide encoded results to gst_audio_decoder_finish_frame. If it is prepared to perform PLC it should also accept NULL data in handle_frame and provide for data for indicated duration. \n"});
