This function will call the create_ringbuffer vmethod and will set src as the parent of the returned buffer see gst_object_set_parent \nQueries whether src will provide a clock or not. See also gst_audio_base_src_set_provide_clock. \nGet the current slave method used by src. \nControls whether src will provide a clock or not. If provide is TRUE gst_element_provide_clock will return a clock that reflects the datarate of src. If provide is FALSE gst_element_provide_clock will return NULL. \nControls how clock slaving will be performed in src. \nActual configured size of audio buffer in microseconds. \nFlags Read \nActual configured audio latency in microseconds. \nFlags Read \ngpointer _gst_reserved \nDifferent possible clock slaving algorithms when the internal audio clock was not selected as the pipeline clock. \nResample to match the master clock. \nGST_AUDIO_BASE_SRC_SLAVE_RETIMESTAMP \nRetimestamp output buffers with master clock time. \nGST_AUDIO_BASE_SRC_SLAVE_SKEW \n"});
