For negative rates out_samples must be negative and in_samples positive. \nWhen out_samples is positive the first sample will be written at position sample in the ringbuffer. When out_samples is negative the last sample will be written to sample in reverse order. \nout_samples does not need to be a multiple of the segment size of the ringbuffer although it is recommended for optimal performance. \naccum will hold a temporary accumulator used in rate conversion and should be set to when this function is first called. In case the commit operation is interrupted one can resume the processing by passing the previously returned accum value back to this function. \nMT safe. \n"});
