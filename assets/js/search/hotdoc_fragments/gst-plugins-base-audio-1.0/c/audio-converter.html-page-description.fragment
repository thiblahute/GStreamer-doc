The return value would be typically input to gst_base_transform_set_in_place \nSet in_rate out_rate and config as extra configuration for convert. \nin_rate and out_rate specify the new sample rates of input and output formats. A value of leaves the sample rate unchanged. \nconfig can be NULL in which case the current configuration is not changed. \nIf the parameters in config can not be set exactly this function returns FALSE and will try to update as much state as possible. The new state can then be retrieved and refined with gst_audio_converter_get_config. \nLook at the GST_AUDIO_CONVERTER_OPT_ fields to check valid configuration option and values. \nthe input sample arrays are writable and can be used as temporary storage during conversion. \nGST_AUDIO_CONVERTER_FLAG_VARIABLE_RATE \nallow arbitrary rate updates with gst_audio_converter_update_config. \nGST_TYPE_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_METHOD The resampler method to use when changing sample rates. Default is GST_AUDIO_RESAMPLER_METHOD_BLACKMAN_NUTTALL. \nGST_TYPE_AUDIO_DITHER_METHOD The dither method to use when changing bit depth. Default is GST_AUDIO_DITHER_NONE. \nGST_TYPE_AUDIO_NOISE_SHAPING_METHOD The noise shaping method to use to mask noise from quantization errors. Default is GST_AUDIO_NOISE_SHAPING_NONE. \nG_TYPE_UINT The quantization amount. Components will be quantized to multiples of this value. Default is \n"});
