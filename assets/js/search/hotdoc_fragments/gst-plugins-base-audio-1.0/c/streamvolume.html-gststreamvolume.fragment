Examples for such elements are volume and playbin. \nApplications can use this interface to get or set the current stream volume. For this the volume GObject property can be used or the helper functions gst_stream_volume_set_volume and gst_stream_volume_get_volume. This volume is always a linear factor i.e. is muted is For showing the volume in a GUI it might make sense to convert it to a different format by using gst_stream_volume_convert_volume. Volume sliders should usually use a cubic volume. \nSeparate from the volume the stream can also be muted by the mute GObject property or gst_stream_volume_set_mute and gst_stream_volume_get_mute. \nElements that provide some kind of stream volume should implement the volume and mute GObject properties and handle setting and getting of them properly. The volume property is defined to be a linear volume factor. \n"});
