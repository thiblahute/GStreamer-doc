Also elements deriving from GstAudioFilter may use gst_audio_filter_class_add_pad_templates from their class_init function to easily configure the set of caps formats that the element is able to handle. \nDerived classes should override the setup and transform_ip and or transform virtual functions in their class_init function. \n"});
