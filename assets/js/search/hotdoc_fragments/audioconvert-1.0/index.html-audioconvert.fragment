It supports integer to float conversion width depth conversion signedness and endianness conversion and channel transformations ie. upmixing and downmixing as well as dithering and noise shaping. \nThis pipeline converts audio to bit. The level element shows that the output levels still match the one for a sine wave. \nThe vorbis encoder takes float audio data instead of the integer data output by most other audio elements. This pipeline decodes a FLAC audio file or any other audio file for which decoders are installed and re encodes it into an Ogg Vorbis audio file. \n"});
