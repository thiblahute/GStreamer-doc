The associated\nlibrary also provides methods for parsing received events, and for sending and\nreceiving navigation related bus events. One main usecase is DVD menu navigation.</p>\n<p>The main parts of the API are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n</li></ul>\n<p>The GstNavigation interface, implemented by elements which provide an application\nwith the ability to create and inject navigation events into the pipeline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n</li></ul>\n<p>GstNavigation event handling API. GstNavigation events are created in response to\ncalls on a GstNavigation interface implementation, and sent in the pipeline. Upstream\nelements can use the navigation event API functions to parse the contents of received\nmessages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n</li></ul>\n<p>GstNavigation message handling API. GstNavigation messages may be sent on the message\nbus to inform applications of navigation related changes in the pipeline, such as the\nmouse moving over a clickable region, or the set of available angles changing.</p>\n<p>The GstNavigation message functions provide functions for creating and parsing\ncustom bus messages for signaling GstNavigation changes.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
