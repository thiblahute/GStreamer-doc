If you press the mouse button somewhere on the\n video and release it somewhere else a green box will appear where you pressed\n the button and a red one where you released it. (The navigationtest element\n is part of gst-plugins-good.) You can observe here that even if the images\n are scaled through hardware the pointer coordinates are converted back to the\n original video frame geometry so that the box can be drawn to the correct\n position. This also handles borders correctly, limiting coordinates to the\n image area\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
