This is because the default reference\nlevel is 89 dB.  To obtain values as lined out in the original proposal of\nReplayGain, set this property to 83.</p>\n<p>Almost all software uses 89 dB as a reference however, and this value has\nbecome the new official value.  That is to say, while the change has been\nacclaimed by the author of the ReplayGain proposal, the <ulink url=\"http://replaygain.org\">webpage</ulink> is still outdated at the time\nof this writing.</p>\n<p>The value was changed because the original proposal recommends a default\npre-amp value of +6 dB for playback.  This seemed a bit odd, as it means\nthat the algorithm has the general tendency to produce adjustment values\nthat are 6 dB too low.  Bumping the reference level by 6 dB compensated for\nthis.</p>\n<p>The problem of the reference level being ambiguous for lack of concise\nstandardization is to be solved by adopting the <a href=\"../libgstreamer-doc-1.0/gsttaglist.html#GST_TAG_REFERENCE_LEVEL\">GST_TAG_REFERENCE_LEVEL</a>\ntag, which allows to store the used value alongside the gain values.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDefault value :\t89\n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n"});
