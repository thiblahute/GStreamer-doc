The echo\ndelay, intensity and the percentage of feedback can be configured.</p>\n<p>For getting an echo effect you have to set the delay to a larger value,\nfor example 200ms and more. Everything below will result in a simple\nreverb effect, which results in a slightly metallic sound.</p>\n<p>Use the max-delay property to set the maximum amount of delay that\nwill be used. This can only be set before going to the PAUSED or PLAYING\nstate and will be set to the current delay by default.</p>\n<p>audioecho can also be used to apply a configurable delay to audio channels\nby setting surround-delay=true. In that mode, it just delays \"surround\nchannels\" by the delay amount instead of performing an echo. The\nchannels that are configured surround channels for the delay are\nselected using the surround-channels mask property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-launch-lines\">Example launch lines</h2>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 autoaudiosrc ! audioconvert ! audioecho delay=500000000 intensity=0.6 feedback=0.4 ! audioconvert ! autoaudiosink\ngst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=\"melo1.ogg\" ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! audioecho delay=50000000 intensity=0.6 feedback=0.4 ! audioconvert ! autoaudiosink\ngst-launch-1.0 audiotestsrc ! audioconvert ! audio/x-raw,channels=4 ! audioecho surround-delay=true delay=500000000 ! audioconvert ! autoaudiosink\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
