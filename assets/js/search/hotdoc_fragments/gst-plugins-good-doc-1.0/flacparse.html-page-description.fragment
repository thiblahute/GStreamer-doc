This is used in the\nmultifdsink case where you want to stream live FLAC streams to multiple\nclients, each client has to receive the streamheaders first before they can\nconsume the FLAC packets.</p>\n<p>This element also makes sure that the buffers that it pushes out are properly\ntimestamped and that their offset and offset_end are set. The buffers that\nflacparse outputs have all of the metadata that oggmux expects to receive,\nwhich allows you to (for example) remux an ogg/flac or convert a native FLAC\nformat file to an ogg bitstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-pipelines\">Example pipelines</h2>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=sine.flac ! flacparse ! identity \\\n           ! oggmux ! filesink location=sine-remuxed.ogg\n</code></pre>\n<p>This pipeline converts a native FLAC format file to an ogg bitstream.\nIt also illustrates that the streamheader is set in the caps, and that each\nbuffer has the timestamp, duration, offset, and offset_end set.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
