Smooth Streaming (ismlmux).</p>\n<p>A few properties (#Gst3GPPMux:movie-timescale, <a href=\"3gppmux.html#Gst3GPPMux:trak-timescale\">trak-timescale</a>)\nallow adjusting some technical parameters, which might be useful in (rare)\ncases to resolve compatibility issues in some situations.</p>\n<p>Some other properties influence the result more fundamentally.\nA typical mov/mp4 file's metadata (aka moov) is located at the end of the file,\nsomewhat contrary to this usually being called \"the header\". However, a\n<a href=\"3gppmux.html#Gst3GPPMux:faststart\">faststart</a> file will (with some effort) arrange this to be located\nnear start of the file, which then allows it e.g. to be played while\ndownloading. Alternatively, rather than having one chunk of metadata at start\n(or end), there can be some metadata at start and most of the other data can\nbe spread out into fragments of <a href=\"3gppmux.html#Gst3GPPMux:fragment-duration\">fragment-duration</a>. If such\nfragmented layout is intended for streaming purposes, then\n<a href=\"3gppmux.html#Gst3GPPMux:streamable\">streamable</a> allows foregoing to add index metadata (at the end of\nfile).</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-pipelines\">Example pipelines</h2>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src num-buffers=50 ! queue ! ffenc_h263 ! 3gppmux ! filesink location=video.3gp\n</code></pre>\n<p>Records a video stream captured from a v4l2 device, encodes it into H.263\nand muxes it into an 3gp file.</p>\n<p>Documentation last reviewed on 2011-04-21</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
