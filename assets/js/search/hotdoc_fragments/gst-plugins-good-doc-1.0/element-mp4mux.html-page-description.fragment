Smooth Streaming (ismlmux).</p>\n<p>A few properties (#GstMp4Mux:movie-timescale, GstMp4Mux:trak-timescale)\nallow adjusting some technical parameters, which might be useful in (rare)\ncases to resolve compatibility issues in some situations.</p>\n<p>Some other properties influence the result more fundamentally.\nA typical mov/mp4 file's metadata (aka moov) is located at the end of the\nfile, somewhat contrary to this usually being called \"the header\".\nHowever, a GstMp4Mux:faststart file will (with some effort) arrange this to\nbe located near start of the file, which then allows it e.g. to be played\nwhile downloading. Alternatively, rather than having one chunk of metadata at\nstart (or end), there can be some metadata at start and most of the other\ndata can be spread out into fragments of GstMp4Mux:fragment-duration.\nIf such fragmented layout is intended for streaming purposes, then\nGstMp4Mux:streamable allows foregoing to add index metadata (at the end of\nfile).</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-pipelines\">Example pipelines</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-[\"> gst-launch-1.0 gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src num-buffers=50 ! queue ! x264enc ! mp4mux ! filesink location=video.mp4\n</code></pre>\n<p>Records a video stream captured from a v4l2 device, encodes it into H.264\nand muxes it into an mp4 file.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
