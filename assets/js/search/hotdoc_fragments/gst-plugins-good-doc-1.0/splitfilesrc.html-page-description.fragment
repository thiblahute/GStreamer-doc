This is useful for reading a large file that\nhad to be split into multiple parts due to filesystem file size limitations,\nfor example.</p>\n<p>The files to select are chosen via the location property, which supports\n(and expects) shell-style wildcards (but only for the filename, not for\ndirectories). The results will be sorted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-launch-lines\">Example launch lines</h2>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 splitfilesrc location=\"/path/to/part-*.mpg\" ! decodebin ! ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Plays the different parts as if they were one single MPEG file.</p>\n<pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=\"splitfile://path/to/foo.avi.*\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Plays the different parts as if they were one single AVI file.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
