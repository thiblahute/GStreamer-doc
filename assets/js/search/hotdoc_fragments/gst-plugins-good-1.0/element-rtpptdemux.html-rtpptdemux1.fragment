Its main purpose is to allow an application to easily receive and decode an RTP stream with multiple payload types. \nFor each payload type that is detected a new pad will be created and the GstRtpPtDemux new payload type signal will be emitted. When the payload for the RTP stream changes the GstRtpPtDemux payload type change signal will be emitted. \nThe element will try to set complete and unique application x rtp caps on the output pads based on the result of the GstRtpPtDemux request pt map signal. \n"});
