Data will flow as usual but the element will not consume CPU time and will not generate result tags. To enable possible skipping set this property to FALSE. \nIf used in conjunction with album processing the element will skip the number of remaining album tracks if a full set of tags is found for the first track. If a subsequent track of the album is missing tags processing cannot start again. If this is undesired the application has to scan all files beforehand and enable forcing of processing if needed. \nFlags Read Write \nDefault value true \n"});
