This is because the default reference level is dB. To obtain values as lined out in the original proposal of ReplayGain set this property to \nAlmost all software uses dB as a reference however and this value has become the new official value. That is to say while the change has been acclaimed by the author of the ReplayGain proposal the webpage is still outdated at the time of this writing. \nThe value was changed because the original proposal recommends a default pre amp value of dB for playback. This seemed a bit odd as it means that the algorithm has the general tendency to produce adjustment values that are dB too low. Bumping the reference level by dB compensated for this. \nThe problem of the reference level being ambiguous for lack of concise standardization is to be solved by adopting the GST_TAG_REFERENCE_LEVEL tag which allows to store the used value alongside the gain values. \nFlags Read Write \nDefault value \n"});
