While moving the mouse pointer over the test signal you will see a black box following the mouse pointer. If you press the mouse button somewhere on the video and release it somewhere else a green box will appear where you pressed the button and a red one where you released it. The navigationtest element is part of gst plugins good. You can observe here that even if the images are scaled through hardware the pointer coordinates are converted back to the original video frame geometry so that the box can be drawn to the correct position. This also handles borders correctly limiting coordinates to the image area \n"});
