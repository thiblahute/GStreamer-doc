Smooth Streaming ismlmux \nA few properties GstQTMux movie timescale trak timescale allow adjusting some technical parameters which might be useful in rare cases to resolve compatibility issues in some situations. \nSome other properties influence the result more fundamentally. A typical mov mp4 file s metadata aka moov is located at the end of the file somewhat contrary to this usually being called the header However a faststart file will with some effort arrange this to be located near start of the file which then allows it e.g. to be played while downloading. Alternatively rather than having one chunk of metadata at start or end there can be some metadata at start and most of the other data can be spread out into fragments of fragment duration. If such fragmented layout is intended for streaming purposes then streamable allows foregoing to add index metadata at the end of file \nWhen the maximum duration to be recorded can be known in advance GstQTMux also supports a Robust Muxing mode. In robust muxing mode space for the headers are reserved at the start of muxing and rewritten at a configurable interval so that the output file is always playable even if the recording is interrupted uncleanly by a crash. Robust muxing mode requires a seekable output such as filesink because it needs to rewrite the start of the file. \nTo enable robust muxing mode set the GstQTMux reserved moov update period and GstQTMux reserved max duration property. Also present is the GstQTMux reserved bytes per sec property which can be increased if for some reason the default is not large enough and the initial reserved space for headers is too small. Applications can monitor the GstQTMux reserved duration remaining property to see how close to full the reserved space is becoming. \n"});
