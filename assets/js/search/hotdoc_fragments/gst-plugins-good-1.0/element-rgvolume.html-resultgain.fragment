Safely means that the volume adjustment does not inflict clipping distortion. Should this not be the case the result gain is set to an appropriately reduced value by applying peak normalization The proposed standard calls this clipping prevention \nThe difference between target and result gain reflects the necessary amount of reduction. Applications can make use of this information to temporarily reduce the pre amp for subsequent streams as recommended by the ReplayGain standard. \nNote that target and result gain differing for a great majority of streams indicates a problem What happens in this case is that most streams receive peak normalization instead of amplification by the ideal replay gain. To prevent this the pre amp has to be lowered and or a limiter has to be used which facilitates the use of headroom. \nFlags Read \nDefault value \n"});
