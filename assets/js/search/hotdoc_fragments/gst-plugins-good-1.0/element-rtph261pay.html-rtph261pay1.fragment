For each fragment an RTP packet is constructed with an RTP packet header followed by the fragment. In addition the payloader will make sure the packetized H.261 stream appears as a continuous bit stream after depacketization by shifting the encoded bit stream of a frame to align with the last significant bit of the previous frame. This helps interoperability in the case where the encoder does not produce a continuous bit stream but the decoder requires it. \n"});
