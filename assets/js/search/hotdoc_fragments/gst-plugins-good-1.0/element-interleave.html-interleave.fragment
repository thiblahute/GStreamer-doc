The first caps on one of the sinkpads will set the caps of the output so usually an audioconvert element should be placed before every sinkpad of interleave. \nIt s possible to change the number of channels while the pipeline is running by adding or removing some of the request pads but this will change the caps of the output buffers. Changing the input caps is not supported yet. \nThe channel number of every sinkpad in the out can be retrieved from the channel property of the pad. \n"});
