An alpha channel is added using an effect specific SMPTE mask in the I420 input case. In the AYUV case the alpha channel is modified using the effect specific SMPTE mask. \nThe GstSmpteAlpha position property is a controllabe double between and that specifies the position in the transition. is the start of the transition with the alpha channel to complete opaque where has the alpha channel set to completely transparent. \nThe GstSmpteAlpha depth property defines the precision in bits of the mask. A higher presision will create a mask with smoother gradients in order to avoid banding. \n"});
