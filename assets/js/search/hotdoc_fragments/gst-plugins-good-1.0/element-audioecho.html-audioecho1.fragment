The echo delay intensity and the percentage of feedback can be configured. \nFor getting an echo effect you have to set the delay to a larger value for example ms and more. Everything below will result in a simple reverb effect which results in a slightly metallic sound. \nUse the max delay property to set the maximum amount of delay that will be used. This can only be set before going to the PAUSED or PLAYING state and will be set to the current delay by default. \naudioecho can also be used to apply a configurable delay to audio channels by setting surround delay true. In that mode it just delays surround channels by the delay amount instead of performing an echo. The channels that are configured surround channels for the delay are selected using the surround channels mask property. \n"});
