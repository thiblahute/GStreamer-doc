The mime type of the data between the tag blocks is detected using typefind functions and the appropriate output mime type set on outgoing buffers. \nThe element is only able to read ID3v1 tags from a seekable stream because they are at the end of the stream. That is when get_range mode is supported by the upstream elements. If get_range operation is available id3demux makes it available downstream. This means that elements which require get_range mode such as wavparse can operate on files containing ID3 tag information. \nThis id3demux element replaced an older element with the same name which relied on libid3tag from the MAD project. \n"});
