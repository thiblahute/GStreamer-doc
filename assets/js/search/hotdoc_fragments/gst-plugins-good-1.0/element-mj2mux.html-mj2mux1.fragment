Smooth Streaming ismlmux \nA few properties GstMJ2Mux movie timescale trak timescale allow adjusting some technical parameters which might be useful in rare cases to resolve compatibility issues in some situations. \nSome other properties influence the result more fundamentally. A typical mov mp4 file s metadata aka moov is located at the end of the file somewhat contrary to this usually being called the header However a faststart file will with some effort arrange this to be located near start of the file which then allows it e.g. to be played while downloading. Alternatively rather than having one chunk of metadata at start or end there can be some metadata at start and most of the other data can be spread out into fragments of fragment duration. If such fragmented layout is intended for streaming purposes then streamable allows foregoing to add index metadata at the end of file \n"});
