It can be combined with RTP depayloaders to implement RTP streaming. \nThe udpsrc element supports automatic port allocation by setting the port property to After setting the udpsrc to PAUSED the allocated port can be obtained by reading the port property. \nudpsrc can read from multicast groups by setting the multicast group property to the IP address of the multicast group. \nAlternatively one can provide a custom socket to udpsrc with the socket property udpsrc will then not allocate a socket itself but use the provided one. \nThe caps property is mainly used to give a type to the UDP packet so that they can be autoplugged in GStreamer pipelines. This is very useful for RTP implementations where the contents of the UDP packets is transfered out of bounds using SDP or other means. \nThe buffer size property is used to change the default kernel buffersizes used for receiving packets. The buffer size may be increased for high volume connections or may be decreased to limit the possible backlog of incoming data. The system places an absolute limit on these values on Linux for example the default buffer size is typically K and can be increased to maximally K. \nThe skip first bytes property is used to strip off an arbitrary number of bytes from the start of the raw udp packet and can be used to strip off proprietary header for example. \nThe udpsrc is always a live source. It does however not provide a GstClock this is left for upstream elements such as an RTP session manager or demuxer such as an MPEG demuxer As with all live sources the captured buffers will have their timestamp set to the current running time of the pipeline. \nudpsrc implements a GstURIHandler interface that handles udp host port type URIs. \nIf the timeout property is set to a value bigger than udpsrc will generate an element message named GstUDPSrcTimeout if no data was recieved in the given timeout. \nThe message s structure contains one field \nThe message is typically used to detect that no UDP arrives in the receiver because it is blocked by a firewall. \nA custom file descriptor can be configured with the socket property. The socket will be closed when setting the element to READY by default. This behaviour can be overriden with the close socket property in which case the application is responsible for closing the file descriptor. \n"});
