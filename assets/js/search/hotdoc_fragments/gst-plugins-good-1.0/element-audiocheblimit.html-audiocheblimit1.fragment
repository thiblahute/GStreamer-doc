It s only disadvantages are the highly non linear phase and the slower rolloff compared to a windowed sinc filter with a large kernel. \nFor type the ripple parameter specifies how much ripple in dB is allowed in the passband i.e. some frequencies in the passband will be amplified by that value. A higher ripple value will allow a faster rolloff. \nFor type the ripple parameter specifies the stopband attenuation. In the stopband the gain will be at most this value. A lower ripple value will allow a faster rolloff. \nAs a special case a Chebyshev type filter with no ripple is a Butterworth filter. \nBe warned that a too large number of poles can produce noise. The most poles are possible with a cutoff frequency at a quarter of the sampling rate. \n"});
