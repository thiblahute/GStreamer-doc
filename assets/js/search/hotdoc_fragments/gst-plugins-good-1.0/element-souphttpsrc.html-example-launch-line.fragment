If the server sends redirects the request fails instead of following the redirect. The specified HTTP proxy server is used. The User Agent HTTP request header is set to a custom string instead of GStreamer souphttpsrc. \nThe above pipeline reads a motion JPEG stream from an IP camera using the HTTP protocol encoded as mime multipart image jpeg parts and writes a Matroska motion JPEG file. The width and height properties are set in the caps to provide the Matroska multiplexer with the information to set this in the header. Timestamps are set on the buffers as they arrive from the camera. These are used by the mime multipart demultiplexer to emit timestamps on the JPEG encoded video frame buffers. This allows the Matroska multiplexer to timestamp the frames in the resulting file. \n"});
