Supported protocols are http https \nAn HTTP proxy must be specified by its URL. If the http_proxy environment variable is set its value is used. If built with libsoup s GNOME integration features the GNOME proxy configuration will be used or failing that proxy autodetection. The proxy property can be used to override the default. \nIn case the iradio mode property is set and the location is an HTTP resource souphttpsrc will send special Icecast HTTP headers to the server to request additional Icecast meta information. If the server is not an Icecast server it will behave as if the iradio mode property were not set. If it is souphttpsrc will output data with a media type of application x icy in which case you will need to use the ICYDemux element as follow up element to extract the Icecast metadata and to determine the underlying media type. \n"});
