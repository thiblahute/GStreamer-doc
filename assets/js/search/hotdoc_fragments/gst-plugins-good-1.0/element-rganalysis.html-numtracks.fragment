This keeps the relative volume levels between the tracks intact. To enable this set this property to the number of streams that will be processed as album tracks. \nEvery time an EOS event is received the value of this property is decremented by one. As it reaches zero it is assumed that the last track of the album finished. The tag list for the final stream will contain the additional tags GST_TAG_ALBUM_GAIN and GST_TAG_ALBUM_PEAK. All other streams just get the two track tags posted because the values for the album tags are not known before all tracks are analyzed. Applications need to ensure that the album gain and peak values are also associated with the other tracks when storing the results. \nIf the total number of album tracks is unknown beforehand just ensure that the value is greater than before each track starts. Then before the end of the last track set it to the value \nTo perform album processing the element has to preserve data between streams. This cannot survive a state change to the NULL or READY state. If you change your pipeline s state to NULL or READY between tracks lock the element s state using gst_element_set_locked_state when it is in PAUSED or PLAYING. \nFlags Read Write \nDefault value \n"});
