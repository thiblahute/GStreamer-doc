Both the interval and the prefered query format can be specified via the update freq and the format property. \nElement messages containing a progress structure are posted on the bus whenever progress has been queried since gst plugins good only \nSince the element was originally designed for debugging purposes it will by default also print information about the current progress to the terminal. This can be prevented by setting the silent property to TRUE. \nThis element is most useful in transcoding pipelines or other situations where just querying the pipeline might not lead to the wanted result. For progress in TIME format the element is best placed in a raw stream section of the pipeline or after any demuxers decoders parsers \nThree more things should be pointed out firstly the element will only query progress when data flow happens. If data flow is stalled for some reason no progress messages will be posted. Secondly there are other elements like qtdemux for example that may also post progress element messages on the bus. Applications should check the source of any element messages they receive if needed. Finally applications should not take action on receiving notification of progress being they should only take action when they receive an EOS message since the progress reported is in reference to an internal point of a pipeline and not the pipeline as a whole \n"});
