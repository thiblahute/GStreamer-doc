Exactly one input video stream can be muxed with as many accompanying audio and subtitle streams as desired. \nBy default it uses mp4mux and filesink but they can be changed via the muxer and sink properties. \nThe minimum file size is GOP however so limits may be overrun if the distance between any keyframes is larger than the limits. \nIf a video stream is available the splitting process is driven by the video stream contents and the video stream must contain closed GOPs for the output file parts to be played individually correctly. In the absence of a video stream the first available stream is used as reference for synchronization. \n"});
