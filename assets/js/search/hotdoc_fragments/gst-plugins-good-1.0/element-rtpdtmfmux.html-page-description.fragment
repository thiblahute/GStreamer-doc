It does exactly what its parent (#rtpmux) does, except\nthat it prevent buffers coming over a regular sink_%u pad from going through\nfor the duration of buffers that came in a priority_sink_%u pad.</p>\n<p>This is especially useful if a discontinuous source like dtmfsrc or\nrtpdtmfsrc are connected to the priority sink pads. This way, the generated\nDTMF signal can replace the recorded audio while the tone is being sent.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
