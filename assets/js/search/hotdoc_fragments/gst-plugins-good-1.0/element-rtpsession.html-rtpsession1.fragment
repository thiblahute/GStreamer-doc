This session can be used to send and receive RTP and RTCP packets. Based on what REQUEST pads are requested from the session manager specific functionality can be activated. \nThe session manager currently implements RFC including \nRTP packet validation based on consecutive sequence numbers. \nMaintainance of the SSRC participant database. \nKeeping per participant statistics based on received RTCP packets. \nScheduling of RR SR RTCP packets. \nSupport for multiple sender SSRC. \nThe rtpsession will not demux packets based on SSRC or payload type nor will it correct for packet reordering and jitter. Use GstRtpsSrcDemux rtpptdemux and GstRtpJitterBuffer in addition to rtpsession to perform these tasks. It is usually a good idea to use rtpbin which combines all these features in one element. \nTo use rtpsession as an RTP receiver request a recv_rtp_sink pad which will automatically create recv_rtp_src pad. Data received on the recv_rtp_sink pad will be processed in the session and after being validated forwarded on the recv_rtp_src pad. \nTo also use rtpsession as an RTCP receiver request a recv_rtcp_sink pad which will automatically create a sync_src pad. Packets received on the RTCP pad will be used by the session manager to update the stats and database of the other participants. SR packets will be forwarded on the sync_src pad so that they can be used to perform inter stream synchronisation when needed. \nIf you want the session manager to generate and send RTCP packets request the send_rtcp_src pad. Packet pushed on this pad contain SR RR RTCP reports that should be sent to all participants in the session. \nTo use rtpsession as a sender request a send_rtp_sink pad which will automatically create a send_rtp_src pad. The session manager will forward the packets on the send_rtp_src pad after updating its internal state. \nThe session manager needs the clock rate of the payload types it is handling and will signal the request pt map signal when it needs such a mapping. One can clear the cached values with the clear pt map signal. \n"});
