When it receives a packet with a sequence number equal to one of the ones stored and with a different SSRC it identifies the new SSRC ssrc2 as the retransmission stream of ssrc1. From this point on it replaces ssrc2 with ssrc1 in all packets of the ssrc2 stream and flags them as retransmissions so that rtpjitterbuffer can reconstruct the original stream. \nThis algorithm is implemented as specified in RFC \nThis element is meant to be used with rtprtxsend on the sender side. See GstRtpRtxSend \nBelow you can see some examples that illustrate how rtprtxreceive and rtprtxsend fit among the other rtp elements and how they work internally. Normally hoewever you should avoid using such pipelines and use rtpbin instead with its GstRtpBin request aux sender and GstRtpBin request aux receiver signals. See GstRtpBin. \n"});
