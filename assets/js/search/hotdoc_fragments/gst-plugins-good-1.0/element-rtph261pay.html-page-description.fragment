For each fragment\nan RTP packet is constructed with an RTP packet header followed by the\nfragment. In addition the payloader will make sure the packetized H.261\nstream appears as a continuous bit-stream after depacketization by shifting\nthe encoded bit-stream of a frame to align with the last significant bit of\nthe previous frame. This helps interoperability in the case where the\nencoder does not produce a continuous bit-stream but the decoder requires\nit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-launch-line\">Example launch line</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-[\"> gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! avenc_h261 ! rtph261pay ! udpsink\n ]| This will encode a test video and payload it.
