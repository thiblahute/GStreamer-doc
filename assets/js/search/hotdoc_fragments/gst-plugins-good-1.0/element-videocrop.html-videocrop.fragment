Unlike videbox it cannot add borders to the picture and unlike videbox it will always output images in exactly the same format as the input image. \nIf there is nothing to crop the element will operate in pass through mode. \nNote that no special efforts are made to handle chroma subsampled formats in the case of odd valued cropping and compensate for sub unit chroma plane shifts for such formats in the case where the left or top property is set to an odd number. This doesn t matter for most use cases but it might matter for yours. \n"});
