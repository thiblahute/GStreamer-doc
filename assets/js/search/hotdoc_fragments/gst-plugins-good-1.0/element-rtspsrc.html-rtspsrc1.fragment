By default rtspsrc will negotiate a connection in the following order UDP unicast UDP multicast TCP. The order cannot be changed but the allowed protocols can be controlled with the protocols property. \nrtspsrc currently understands SDP as the format of the session description. For each stream listed in the SDP a new rtp_stream d pad will be created with caps derived from the SDP media description. This is a caps of mime type application x rtp that can be connected to any available RTP depayloader element. \nrtspsrc will internally instantiate an RTP session manager element that will handle the RTCP messages to and from the server jitter removal packet reordering along with providing a clock for the pipeline. This feature is implemented using the gstrtpbin element. \nrtspsrc acts like a live source and will therefore only generate data in the PLAYING state. \n"});
