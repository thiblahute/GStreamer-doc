That is a buffer s caps are updated using fields of caps. Note that this may contain multiple structures though not likely recommended but each of these must be fixed or will otherwise be rejected \nIf join is TRUE then the incoming caps mime type is compared to the mime type s of provided caps and only matching structure s are considered for updating. \nIf replace is TRUE then any caps update is preceded by clearing existing fields making provided fields as a whole replace incoming ones. Otherwise no clearing is performed in which case provided fields are added merged onto incoming caps \nAlthough this element might mainly serve as debug helper it can also practically be used to correct a faulty pixel aspect ratio or to modify a yuv fourcc value to effectively swap chroma components or such alike. \n"});
