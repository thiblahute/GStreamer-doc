Instead of GST_LOG as an example you can also use GST_LOG_OBJECT to print the object that you re logging output for. \nIdeally elements should use their own debugging category. Most elements use the following code to do that \nAt runtime you can turn on debugging using the commandline option gst debug myelement \nElements should use GST_DEBUG_FUNCPTR when setting pad functions or overriding element class methods for example \nThis makes debug output much easier to read later on. \nElements that are aimed for inclusion into one of the GStreamer modules should ensure consistent naming of the element name structures and function names. For example if the element type is GstYellowFooDec functions should be prefixed with gst_yellow_foo_dec_ and the element should be registered as yellowfoodec Separate words should be separate in this scheme so it should be GstFooDec and gst_foo_dec and not GstFoodec and gst_foodec. \n"});
