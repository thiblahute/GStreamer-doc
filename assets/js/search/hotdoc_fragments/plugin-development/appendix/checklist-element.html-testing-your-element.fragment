Applications such as Rhythmbox and Totem for GNOME or AmaroK for KDE are. gst launch will not test various things such as proper clean up on reset event handling querying and so on. \nParsers and demuxers should make sure to check their input. Input cannot be trusted. Prevent possible buffer overflows and the like. Feel free to error out on unrecoverable stream errors. Test your demuxer using stream corruption elements such as breakmydata included in gst plugins It will randomly insert delete and modify bytes in a stream and is therefore a good test for robustness. If your element crashes when adding this element your element needs fixing. If it errors out properly it s good enough. Ideally it d just continue to work and forward data as much as possible. \nDemuxers should not assume that seeking works. Be prepared to work with unseekable input streams e.g. network sources as well. \nSources and sinks should be prepared to be assigned another clock then the one they expose themselves. Always use the provided clock for synchronization else you ll get A V sync issues. \n"});
