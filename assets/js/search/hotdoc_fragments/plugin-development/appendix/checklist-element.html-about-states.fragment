Ideally this should set all object properties to their original state. This function should also be called from _init. \nMake sure an element forgets everything about its contained stream when going from PAUSED to READY. In READY all stream states are reset. An element that goes from PAUSED to READY and back to PAUSED should start reading the stream from the start again. \nPeople that use gst launch for testing have the tendency to not care about cleaning up. This is wrong. An element should be tested using various applications where testing not only means to make sure it doesn t crash but also to test for memory leaks using tools such as valgrind. Elements have to be reusable in a pipeline after having been reset. \n"});
