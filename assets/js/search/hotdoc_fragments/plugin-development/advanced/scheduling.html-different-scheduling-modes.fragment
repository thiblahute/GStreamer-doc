GStreamer can operate in two scheduling mode called push and pull mode. GStreamer supports elements with pads in any of the scheduling modes where not all pads need to be operating in the same mode. \nSo far we have only discussed _chain operating elements i.e. elements that have a chain function set on their sink pad and push buffers on their source pad s We call this the push mode because a peer element will use gst_pad_push on a srcpad which will cause our _chain function to be called which in turn causes our element to push out a buffer on the source pad. The initiative to start the dataflow happens somewhere upstream when it pushes out a buffer and all downstream elements get scheduled when their _chain functions are called in turn. \nBefore we explain pull mode scheduling let s first understand how the different scheduling modes are selected and activated on a pad. \n"});
