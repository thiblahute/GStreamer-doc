fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "plugin-development/advanced/request.html#request-pads", "fragment": "Request pads \nRequest pads are similar to sometimes pads except that request are created on demand of something outside of the element rather than something inside the element. This concept is often used in muxers where for each elementary stream that is to be placed in the output system stream one sink pad will be requested. It can also be used in elements with a variable number of input or outputs pads such as the tee multi output or input selector multi input elements. \nTo implement request pads you need to provide a padtemplate with a GST_PAD_REQUEST presence and implement the request_new_pad virtual method in GstElement. To clean up you will need to implement the release_pad virtual method. \n"});
