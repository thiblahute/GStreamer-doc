In throttle mode the time distance between buffers is kept to a configurable throttle interval. This means that effectively the buffer rate is limited to buffer per throttle interval. This can be used to limit the framerate for example. \nWhen an element is configured in throttling mode this is usually only implemented on sinks it should produce QoS events upstream with the jitter field set to the throttle interval. This should instruct upstream elements to skip or drop the remaining buffers in the configured throttle interval. \nThe proportion field is set to the desired slowdown needed to get the desired throttle interval. Implementations can use the QoS Throttle type the proportion and the jitter member to tune their implementations. \nThe default sink base class has the throttle time property for this feature. You can test this with gst launch videotestsrc xvimagesink throttle time \n"});
