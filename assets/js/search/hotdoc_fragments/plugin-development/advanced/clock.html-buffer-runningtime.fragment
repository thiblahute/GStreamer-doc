fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "plugin-development/advanced/clock.html#buffer-runningtime", "fragment": "Buffer running time \nTo calculate a buffer running time we need a buffer timestamp and the SEGMENT event that preceded the buffer. First we can convert the SEGMENT event into a GstSegment object and then we can use the gst_segment_to_running_time function to perform the calculation of the buffer running time. \nSynchronization is now a matter of making sure that a buffer with a certain running time is played when the clock reaches the same running time. Usually this task is done by sink elements. Sink also have to take into account the latency configured in the pipeline and add this to the buffer running time before synchronizing to the pipeline clock. \n"});
