This is currently used to preserve tags during stream transcoding from one format to the other. Tags are discussed extensively in Tagging Metadata and Streaminfo Most elements will simply forward the event by calling gst_pad_event_default \nThe tag event is created using the function gst_event_new_tag but more often elements will send a tag event downstream that will be converted into a message on the bus by sink elements. All of these functions require a filled in taglist as argument which they will take ownership of. \nElements parsing this event can use the function gst_event_parse_tag to acquire the taglist that the event contains. \n"});
