It represents the multimedia content that is pushed or pull downstream by elements. \nThe buffer contains one or more GstMemory objects that represent the data in the buffer. \nMetadata in the buffer consists of \nDTS and PTS timestamps. These represent the decoding and presentation timestamps of the buffer content and is used by synchronizing elements to schedule buffers. Both these timestamps can be GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE when unknown undefined. \nThe duration of the buffer contents. This duration can be GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE when unknown undefined. \nMedia specific offsets and offset_end. For video this is the frame number in the stream and for audio the sample number. Other definitions for other media exist. \nArbitrary structures via GstMeta see below. \n"});
