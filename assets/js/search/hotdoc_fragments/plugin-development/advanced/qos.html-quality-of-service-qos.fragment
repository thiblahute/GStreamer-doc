The real time performance is always measured relative to the pipeline clock and typically happens in the sinks when they synchronize buffers against the clock. \nWhen buffers arrive late in the sink i.e. when their running time is smaller than that of the clock we say that the pipeline is having a quality of service problem. These are a few possible reasons \nHigh CPU load there is not enough CPU power to handle the stream causing buffers to arrive late in the sink. \nNetwork problems \nOther resource problems such as disk load memory bottlenecks etc \nThe measurements result in QOS events that aim to adjust the datarate in one or more upstream elements. Two types of adjustments can be made \nShort time emergency corrections based on latest observation in the sinks. \nLong term rate corrections based on trends observed in the sinks. \nIt is also possible for the application to artificially introduce delay between synchronized buffers this is called throttling. It can be used to limit or reduce the framerate for example. \n"});
