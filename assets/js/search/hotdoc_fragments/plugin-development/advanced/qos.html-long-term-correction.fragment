They rely on the value of the proportion in the QOS event. Elements should reduce the amount of resources they consume by the proportion field in the QoS message. \nHere are some possible strategies to achieve this \nPermanently dropping frames or reducing the CPU or bandwidth requirements of the element. Some decoders might be able to skip decoding of B frames. \nSwitch to lower quality processing or reduce the algorithmic complexity. Care should be taken that this doesn t introduce disturbing visual or audible glitches. \nSwitch to a lower quality source to reduce network bandwidth. \nAssign more CPU cycles to critical parts of the pipeline. This could for example be done by increasing the thread priority. \nIn all cases elements should be prepared to go back to their normal processing rate when the proportion member in the QOS event approaches the ideal proportion of again. \n"});
