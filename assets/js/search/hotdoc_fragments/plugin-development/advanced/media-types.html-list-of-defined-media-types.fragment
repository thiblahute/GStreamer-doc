They are split up in separate tables for audio video container subtitle and other types for the sake of readability. Below each table might follow a list of notes that apply to that table. In the definition of each type we try to follow the types and rules as defined by IANA for as far as possible. \nJump directly to a specific table \nTable of Audio Types \nTable of Video Types \nTable of Container Types \nTable of Subtitle Types \nTable of Other Types \nNote that many of the properties are not required but rather optional properties. This means that most of these properties can be extracted from the container header but that in case the container header does not provide these they can also be extracted by parsing the stream header or the stream content. The policy is that your element should provide the data that it knows about by only parsing its own content not another element s content. Example the AVI header provides samplerate of the contained audio stream in the header. MPEG system streams don t. This means that an AVI stream demuxer would provide samplerate as a property for MPEG audio streams whereas an MPEG demuxer would not. A decoder needing this data would require a stream parser in between two extract this from the header or calculate it from the stream. \n"});
