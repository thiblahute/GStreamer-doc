A media type would ideally be equivalent to the Mime type defined by IANA else it should be in the form type x name where type is the sort of data this media type handles audio video and name should be something specific for this specific type. Audio and video media types should try to support the general audio video properties see the list and can use their own properties too. To get an idea of what properties we think are useful see again the list. \nTake your time to find the right set of properties for your type. There is no reason to hurry. Also experimenting with this is generally a good idea. Experience learns that theoretically thought out types are good but they still need practical use to assure that they serve their needs. Make sure that your property names do not clash with similar properties used in other types. If they match make sure they mean the same thing properties with different types but the same names are not allowed. \n"});
