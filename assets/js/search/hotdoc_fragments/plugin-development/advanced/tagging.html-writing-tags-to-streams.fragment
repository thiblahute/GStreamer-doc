Tag writers only take metadata tags into account since that s the only type of tags that have to be written into a stream. Tag writers can receive tags in three ways internal application and pipeline. Internal tags are tags read by the element itself which means that the tag writer is in that case a tag reader too. Application tags are tags provided to the element via the TagSetter interface which is just a layer Pipeline tags are tags provided to the element from within the pipeline. The element receives such tags via the GST_EVENT_TAG event which means that tags writers should implement an event handler. The tag writer is responsible for combining all these three into one list and writing them to the output stream. \nThe example below will receive tags from both application and pipeline combine them and write them to the output stream. It implements the tag setter so applications can set tags and retrieves pipeline tags from incoming events. \nWarning this example is outdated and doesn t work with the version of GStreamer anymore. \nNote that normally elements would not read the full stream before processing tags. Rather they would read from each sinkpad until they ve received data since tags usually come in before the first data buffer and process that. \n"});
