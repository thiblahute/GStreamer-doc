fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "plugin-development/advanced/tagging.html#reading-tags-from-streams", "fragment": "Reading Tags from Streams \nThe basic object for tags is a GstTagList. An element that is reading tags from a stream should create an empty taglist and fill this with individual tags. Empty tag lists can be created with gst_tag_list_new Then the element can fill the list using gst_tag_list_add or gst_tag_list_add_values Note that elements often read metadata as strings but the values in the taglist might not necessarily be strings they need to be of the type the tag was registered as the API documentation for each predefined tag should contain the type Be sure to use functions like gst_value_transform to make sure that your data is of the right type. After data reading you can send the tags downstream with the TAG event. When the TAG event reaches the sink it will post the TAG message on the pipeline s GstBus for the application to pick up. \nWe currently require the core to know the GType of tags before they are being used so all tags must be registered first. You can add new tags to the list of known tags using gst_tag_register If you think the tag will be useful in more cases than just your own element it might be a good idea to add it to gsttag.c instead. That s up to you to decide. If you want to do it in your own element it s easiest to register the tag in one of your class init functions preferably _class_init \n"});
