If the jitter is positive the previous buffer arrived late and we can be sure that a buffer with a timestamp timestamp jitter is also going to be late. We can thus drop all buffers with a timestamp less than timestamp jitter. \nIf the buffer duration is known a better estimation for the next likely timestamp as timestamp jitter duration. \nA possible algorithm typically looks like this \n"});
