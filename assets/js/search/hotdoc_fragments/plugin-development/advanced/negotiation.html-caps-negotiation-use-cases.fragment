The pull mode scheduling negotiation phase is discussed in Pull mode Caps negotiation and is actually similar as we will see. \nSince the sink pads only suggest formats and the source pads need to decide the most complicated work is done in the source pads. We can identify caps negotiation use cases for the source pads \nFixed negotiation. An element can output one format only. See Fixed negotiation. \nTransform negotiation. There is a fixed transform between the input and output format of the element usually based on some element property. The caps that the element will produce depend on the upstream caps and the caps that the element can accept depend on the downstream caps. See Transform negotiation. \nDynamic negotiation. An element can output many formats. See Dynamic negotiation. \n"});
