This transformation could be parameterized by element properties but not by the content of the stream see Fixed negotiation for that use case \nThe caps that the element can accept depend on the fixed transformation downstream caps. The caps that the element can produce depend on the fixed transformation of the upstream caps. \nThis type of element can usually set caps on its source pad from the _event function on the sink pad when it received the CAPS event. This means that the caps transform function transforms a fixed caps into another fixed caps. Examples of elements include \nVideobox. It adds configurable border around a video frame depending on object properties. \nIdentity elements. All elements that don t change the format of the data only the content. Video and audio effects are an example. Other examples include elements that inspect the stream. \nSome decoders and encoders where the output format is defined by input format like mulawdec and mulawenc. These decoders usually have no headers that define the content of the stream. They are usually more like conversion elements. \nBelow is an example of a negotiation steps of a typical transform element. In the sink pad CAPS event handler we compute the caps for the source pad and set those. \n"});
