The problem here is that audio has a much higher rate. For PAL video one will e.g. process full frames per second but for standard audio it will be samples. It is rarely useful to synchronise controllable parameters that often. The easiest solution is also to have just one synchronisation call per buffer processing. This makes the control rate depend on the buffer size. \nElements that need a specific control rate need to break their data processing loop to synchronise every n samples. \n"});
