Within this task function you have random access over all of the sinkpads and push data over the sourcepads. This can come in useful for several different kinds of elements \nDemuxers parsers and certain kinds of decoders where data comes in unparsed such as MPEG audio or video streams since those will prefer byte exact random access from their input. If possible however such elements should be prepared to operate in push mode mode too. \nCertain kind of audio outputs which require control over their input data flow such as the Jack sound server. \nFirst you need to perform a SCHEDULING query to check if the upstream element s support pull mode scheduling. If that is possible you can activate the sinkpad in pull mode. Inside the activate_mode function you can then start the task. \nOnce started your task has full control over input and output. The most simple case of a task function is one that reads input and pushes that over its source pad. It s not all that useful but provides some more flexibility than the old push mode case that we ve been looking at so far. \n"});
