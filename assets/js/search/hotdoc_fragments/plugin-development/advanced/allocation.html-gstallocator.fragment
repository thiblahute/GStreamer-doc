fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "plugin-development/advanced/allocation.html#gstallocator", "fragment": "GstAllocator \nGstMemory objects are created by a GstAllocator object. Most allocators implement the default gst_allocator_alloc method but some allocator might implement a different method for example when additional parameters are needed to allocate the specific memory. \nDifferent allocators exist for for example system memory shared memory and memory backed by a DMAbuf file descriptor. To implement support for a new kind of memory type you must implement a new allocator object as shown below. \n"});
