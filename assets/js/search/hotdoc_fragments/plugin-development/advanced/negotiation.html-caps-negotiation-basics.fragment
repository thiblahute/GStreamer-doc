See also Implementing a CAPS query function. \nAn upstream element decides on a format. It sends the selected media format downstream on its source pad with a CAPS event. Downstream elements reconfigure themselves to handle the media type in the CAPS event on the sinkpad. \nA downstream element can inform upstream that it would like to suggest a new format by sending a RECONFIGURE event upstream. The RECONFIGURE event simply instructs an upstream element to restart the negotiation phase. Because the element that sent out the RECONFIGURE event is now suggesting another format the format in the pipeline might change. \nIn addition to the CAPS and RECONFIGURE event and the CAPS query there is an ACCEPT_CAPS query to quickly check if a certain caps can be accepted by an element. \nAll negotiation follows these simple rules. Let s take a look at some typical uses cases and how negotiation happens. \n"});
