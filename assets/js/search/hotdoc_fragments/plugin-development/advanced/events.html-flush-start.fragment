fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "plugin-development/advanced/events.html#flush-start", "fragment": "Flush Start \nThe flush start event is sent downstream in push mode or upstream in pull mode if all buffers and caches in the pipeline should be emptied. Queue elements will empty their internal list of buffers when they receive this event for example. File sink elements e.g. filesink will flush the kernel to disk cache fdatasync or fflush when they receive this event. Normally elements receiving this event will simply just forward it since most filter or filter like elements don t have an internal cache of data. gst_pad_event_default does just that so for most elements it is enough to forward the event using the default event handler. \nAs a side effect of flushing all data from the pipeline this event unblocks the streaming thread by making all pads reject data until they receive a Flush Stop signal elements trying to push data will get a FLUSHING flow return and stop processing data \nThe flush start event is created with the gst_event_new_flush_start Like the EOS event it has no properties. This event is usually only created by elements driving the pipeline like source elements operating in push mode or pull range based demuxers decoders. \n"});
