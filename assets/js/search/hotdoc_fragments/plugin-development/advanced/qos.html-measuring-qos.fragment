fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "plugin-development/advanced/qos.html#measuring-qos", "fragment": "Measuring QoS \nElements that synchronize buffers on the pipeline clock will usually measure the current QoS. They will also need to keep some statistics in order to generate the QOS event. \nFor each buffer that arrives in the sink the element needs to calculate how late or how early it was. This is called the jitter. Negative jitter values mean that the buffer was early positive values mean that the buffer was late. the jitter value gives an indication of how early late a buffer was. \nA synchronizing element will also need to calculate how much time elapsed between receiving two consecutive buffers. We call this the processing time because that is the amount of time it takes for the upstream element to produce process the buffer. We can compare this processing time to the duration of the buffer to have a measurement of how fast upstream can produce data called the proportion. If for example upstream can produce a buffer in seconds of second long it is operating at twice the required speed. If on the other hand it takes seconds to produce a buffer with seconds worth of data upstream is producing buffers too slow and we won t be able to keep synchronization. Usually a running average is kept of the proportion. \nA synchronizing element also needs to measure its own performance in order to figure out if the performance problem is upstream of itself. \nThese measurements are used to construct a QOS event that is sent upstream. Note that a QoS event is sent for each buffer that arrives in the sink. \n"});
