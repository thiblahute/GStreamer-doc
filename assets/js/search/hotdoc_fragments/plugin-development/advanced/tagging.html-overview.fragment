fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "plugin-development/advanced/tagging.html#overview", "fragment": "Overview \nTags are pieces of information stored in a stream that are not the content itself but they rather describe the content. Most media container formats support tagging in one way or another. Ogg uses VorbisComment for this MP3 uses ID3 AVI and WAV use RIFF s INFO list chunk etc. GStreamer provides a general way for elements to read tags from the stream and expose this to the user. The tags at least the metadata will be part of the stream inside the pipeline. The consequence of this is that transcoding of files from one format to another will automatically preserve tags as long as the input and output format elements both support tagging. \nTags are separated in two categories in GStreamer even though applications won t notice anything of this. The first are called metadata the second are called streaminfo. Metadata are tags that describe the non technical parts of stream content. They can be changed without needing to re encode the stream completely. Examples are author title or album The container format might still need to be re written for the tags to fit in though. Streaminfo on the other hand are tags that describe the stream contents technically. To change them the stream needs to be re encoded. Examples are codec or bitrate Note that some container formats like ID3 store various streaminfo tags as metadata in the file container which means that they can be changed so that they don t match the content in the file any more. Still they are called metadata because technically they can be changed without re encoding the whole stream even though that makes them invalid. Files with such metadata tags will have the same tag twice once as metadata once as streaminfo. \nThere is no special name for tag reading elements in GStreamer. There are specialised elements e.g. id3demux that do nothing besides tag reading but any GStreamer element may extract tags while processing data and most decoders demuxers and parsers do. \nA tag writer is called TagSetter. An element supporting both can be used in a tag editor for quick tag changing note in place tag editing is still poorly supported at the time of writing and usually requires tag extraction stripping and remuxing of the stream with new tags \n"});
