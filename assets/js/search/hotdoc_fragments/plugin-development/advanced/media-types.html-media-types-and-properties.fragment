Indeed each new element that is defined may use a new data format though unless at least one other element recognises that format it will be most likely be useless since nothing will be able to link with it \nIn order for media types to be useful and for systems like autopluggers to work it is necessary that all elements agree on the media type definitions and which properties are required for each media type. The GStreamer framework itself simply provides the ability to define media types and parameters but does not fix the meaning of media types and parameters and does not enforce standards on the creation of new media types. This is a matter for a policy to decide not technical systems to enforce. \nFor now the policy is simple \nDo not create a new media type if you could use one which already exists. \nIf creating a new media type discuss it first with the other GStreamer developers on at least one of IRC mailing lists. \nTry to ensure that the name for a new format is as unlikely to conflict with anything else created already and is not a more generalised name than it should be. For example audio compressed would be too generalised a name to represent audio data compressed with an mp3 codec. Instead audio mp3 might be an appropriate name or audio compressed could exist and have a property indicating the type of compression used. \nEnsure that when you do create a new media type you specify it clearly and get it added to the list of known media types so that other developers can use the media type correctly when writing their elements. \n"});
