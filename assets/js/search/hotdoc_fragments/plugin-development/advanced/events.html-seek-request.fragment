fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "plugin-development/advanced/events.html#seek-request", "fragment": "Seek Request \nSeek events are meant to request a new stream position to elements. This new position can be set in several formats time bytes or default units a term indicating frames for video channel independent samples for audio etc. Seeking can be done with respect to the end of file or start of file and usually happens in upstream direction downstream seeking is done by sending a SEGMENT event with the appropriate offsets for elements that support that like filesink \nElements receiving seek events should depending on the element type either just forward it upstream filters decoders change the format in which the event is given and then forward it demuxers or handle the event by changing the file pointer in their internal stream resource file sources demuxers decoders driving the pipeline in pull mode or something else. \nSeek events are built up using positions in specified formats time bytes units They are created using the function gst_event_new_seek Note that many plugins do not support seeking from the end of the stream. An element not driving the pipeline and forwarding a seek request should not assume that the seek succeeded or actually happened it should operate based on the SEGMENT events it receives. \nElements parsing this event can do this using gst_event_parse_seek \n"});
