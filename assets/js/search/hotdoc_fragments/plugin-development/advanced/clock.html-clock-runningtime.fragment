So \nrunning time absolute time base time \nA GStreamer GstPipeline object maintains a GstClock object and a base time when it goes to the PLAYING state. The pipeline gives a handle to the selected GstClock to each element in the pipeline along with selected base time. The pipeline will select a base time in such a way that the running time reflects the total time spent in the PLAYING state. As a result when the pipeline is PAUSED the running time stands still. \nBecause all objects in the pipeline have the same clock and base time they can thus all calculate the running time according to the pipeline clock. \n"});
