In the case of a simple filter _chain functions are mostly linear functions so for each incoming buffer one buffer will go out too. Below is a very simple implementation of a chain function \nObviously the above doesn t do much useful. Instead of printing that the data is in you would normally process the data there. Remember however that buffers are not always writeable. \nIn more advanced elements the ones that do event processing you may want to additionally specify an event handling function which will be called when stream events are sent such as caps end of stream newsegment tags etc. \nIn some cases it might be useful for an element to have control over the input data rate too. In that case you probably want to write a so called loop based element. Source elements with only source pads can also be get based elements. These concepts will be explained in the advanced section of this guide and in the section that specifically discusses source pads. \n"});
