In this part of the\nguide, you will learn how to apply basic GStreamer programming concepts\nto write a simple plugin. The previous parts of the guide have contained\nno explicit example code, perhaps making things a bit abstract and\ndifficult to understand. In contrast, this section will present both\napplications and code by following the development of an example audio\nfilter plugin called \u201cMyFilter\u201d.</p>\n<p>The example filter element will begin with a single input pad and a\nsingle output pad. The filter will, at first, simply pass media and\nevent data from its sink pad to its source pad without modification. But\nby the end of this part of the guide, you will learn to add some more\ninteresting functionality, including properties and signal handlers. And\nafter reading the next part of the guide, <a href=\"../advanced/index.html\">Advanced Filter Concepts</a>,\nyou will be able to add even more functionality to your plugins.</p>\n\n        \n\n    </div>\n\n\n        "});
