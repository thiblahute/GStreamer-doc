In the boilerplate code, we have seen how\nstatic pad templates take care of registering pad templates with the\nelement class. Here, we will see how to create actual elements, use an\n<code>_event ()</code>-function to configure for a particular format and how to register\nfunctions to let data flow through the element.</p>\n<p>In the element <code>_init ()</code> function, you create the pad from the pad\ntemplate that has been registered with the element class in the\n<code>_class_init ()</code> function. After creating the pad, you have to set a\n<code>_chain ()</code> function pointer that will receive and process the input\ndata on the sinkpad. You can optionally also set an <code>_event ()</code> function\npointer and a <code>_query ()</code> function pointer. Alternatively, pads can also\noperate in looping mode, which means that they can pull data themselves.\nMore on this topic later. After that, you have to register the pad with\nthe element. This happens like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">\n\n\nstatic void\ngst_my_filter_init (GstMyFilter *filter)\n{\n  /* pad through which data comes in to the element */\n  filter-&gt;sinkpad = gst_pad_new_from_static_template (\n    &amp;sink_template, \"sink\");\n  /* pads are configured here with gst_pad_set_*_function () */\n\n\n\n  gst_element_add_pad (GST_ELEMENT (filter), filter-&gt;sinkpad);\n\n  /* pad through which data goes out of the element */\n  filter-&gt;srcpad = gst_pad_new_from_static_template (\n    &amp;src_template, \"src\");\n  /* pads are configured here with gst_pad_set_*_function () */\n\n\n\n  gst_element_add_pad (GST_ELEMENT (filter), filter-&gt;srcpad);\n\n  /* properties initial value */\n  filter-&gt;silent = FALSE;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n        \n\n    </div>\n\n\n        "});
