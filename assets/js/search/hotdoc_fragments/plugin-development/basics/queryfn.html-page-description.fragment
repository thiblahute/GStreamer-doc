These are queries like position duration but also about the supported formats and scheduling modes your element supports. Queries can travel both upstream and downstream so you can receive them on sink pads as well as source pads. \nBelow follows a very simple query function that we install on the source pad of our element. \nIt is a good idea to call the default query handler gst_pad_query_default for unknown queries. Depending on the query type the default handler will forward the query or simply unref it. \n"});
