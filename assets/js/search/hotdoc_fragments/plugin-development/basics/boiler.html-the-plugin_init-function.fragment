This is a special function which is called as soon as the plugin is loaded and should return TRUE or FALSE depending on whether it loaded initialized any dependencies correctly. Also in this function any supported element type in the plugin should be registered. \nNote that the information returned by the plugin_init function will be cached in a central registry. For this reason it is important that the same information is always returned by the function for example it must not make element factories available based on runtime conditions. If an element can only work in certain conditions for example if the soundcard is not being used by some other process this must be reflected by the element being unable to enter the READY state if unavailable rather than the plugin attempting to deny existence of the plugin. \n"});
