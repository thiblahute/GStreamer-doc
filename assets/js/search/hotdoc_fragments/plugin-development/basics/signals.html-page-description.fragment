Note, however, that the application needs to be aware of\nsignals and their meaning, so if you're looking for a generic way for\napplication-element interaction, signals are probably not what you're\nlooking for. In many cases, however, signals can be very useful. See the\n<a href=\"http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/\">GObject documentation</a>\nfor all internals about signals.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
