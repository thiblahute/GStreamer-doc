The second method is by far the simpler of the two so the first method will not even be described here. Errm that is it is left as an exercise to the reader. \nThe first step is to check out a copy of the gst template git module to get an important tool and the source code template for a basic GStreamer plugin. To check out the gst template module make sure you are connected to the internet and type the following commands at a command console \nThis command will check out a series of files and directories into gst template. The template you will be using is in the gst template gst plugin directory. You should look over the files in that directory to get a general idea of the structure of a source tree for a plugin. \nIf for some reason you can t access the git repository you can also download a snapshot of the latest revision via the cgit web interface. \n"});
