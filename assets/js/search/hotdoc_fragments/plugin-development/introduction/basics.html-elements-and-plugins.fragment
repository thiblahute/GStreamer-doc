In the context of plugin development an element is an object derived from the GstElement class. Elements provide some sort of functionality when linked with other elements For example a source element provides data to a stream and a filter element acts on the data in a stream. Without elements GStreamer is just a bunch of conceptual pipe fittings with nothing to link. A large number of elements ship with GStreamer but extra elements can also be written. \nJust writing a new element is not entirely enough however You will need to encapsulate your element in a plugin to enable GStreamer to use it. A plugin is essentially a loadable block of code usually called a shared object file or a dynamically linked library. A single plugin may contain the implementation of several elements or just a single one. For simplicity this guide concentrates primarily on plugins containing one element. \nA filter is an important type of element that processes a stream of data. Producers and consumers of data are called source and sink elements respectively. Bin elements contain other elements. One type of bin is responsible for synchronization of the elements that they contain so that data flows smoothly. Another type of bin called autoplugger elements automatically add other elements to the bin and links them together so that they act as a filter between two arbitrary stream types. \nThe plugin mechanism is used everywhere in GStreamer even if only the standard packages are being used. A few very basic functions reside in the core library and all others are implemented in plugins. A plugin registry is used to store the details of the plugins in an binary registry file. This way a program using GStreamer does not have to load all plugins to determine which are needed. Plugins are only loaded when their provided elements are requested. \nSee the GStreamer Library Reference for the current implementation details of GstElement and GstPlugin. \n"});
