The guide is relevant to several groups of people \nAnyone who wants to add support for new ways of processing data in GStreamer. For example a person in this group might want to create a new data format converter a new visualization tool or a new decoder or encoder. \nAnyone who wants to add support for new input and output devices. For example people in this group might want to add the ability to write to a new video output system or read data from a digital camera or special microphone. \nAnyone who wants to extend GStreamer in any way. You need to have an understanding of how the plugin system works before you can understand the constraints that the plugin system places on the rest of the code. Also you might be surprised after reading this at how much can be done with plugins. \nThis guide is not relevant to you if you only want to use the existing functionality of GStreamer or if you just want to use an application that uses GStreamer. If you are only interested in using existing plugins to write a new application and there are quite a lot of plugins already you might want to check the GStreamer Application Development Manual. If you are just trying to get help with a GStreamer application then you should check with the user manual for that particular application. \n"});
