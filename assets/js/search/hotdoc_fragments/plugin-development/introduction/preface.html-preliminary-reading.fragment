For a gentle introduction to programming concepts in GStreamer you may wish to read the GStreamer Application Development Manual first. Also check out the other documentation available on the GStreamer web site. \nIn order to understand this manual you will need to have a basic understanding of the C language. Since GStreamer adheres to the GObject programming model this guide also assumes that you understand the basics of GObject programming. You may also want to have a look at Eric Harlow s book Developing Linux Applications with GTK and GDK. \n"});
