GstMiniObject is the structure used to hold these chunks of data. \nGstMiniObject contains the following important types \nAn exact type indicating what type of data event buffer this GstMiniObject is. \nA reference count indicating the number of elements currently holding a reference to the miniobject. When the reference count falls to zero the miniobject will be disposed and its memory will be freed in some sense see below for more details \nFor data transport there are two types of GstMiniObject defined events control and buffers content \nBuffers may contain any sort of data that the two linked pads know how to handle. Normally a buffer contains a chunk of some sort of audio or video data that flows from one element to another. \nBuffers also contain metadata describing the buffer s contents. Some of the important types of metadata are \nPointers to one or more GstMemory objects. GstMemory objects are refcounted objects that encapsulate a region of memory. \nA timestamp indicating the preferred display timestamp of the content in the buffer. \nEvents contain information on the state of the stream flowing between the two linked pads. Events will only be sent if the element explicitly supports them else the core will try to handle the events automatically. Events are used to indicate for example a media type the end of a media stream or that the cache should be flushed. \nEvents may contain several of the following items \nA subtype indicating the type of the contained event. \nThe other contents of the event depend on the specific event type. \nEvents will be discussed extensively in Events Seeking Navigation and More. Until then the only event that will be used is the EOS event which is used to indicate the end of stream usually end of file \nSee the GStreamer Library Reference for the current implementation details of a GstMiniObject GstBuffer and GstEvent. \n"});
