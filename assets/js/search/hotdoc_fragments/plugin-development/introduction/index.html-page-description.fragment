Many of the virtues of the GStreamer\nframework come from its modularity: GStreamer can seamlessly incorporate\nnew plugin modules. But because modularity and power often come at a\ncost of greater complexity (consider, for example,\n<a href=\"http://www.omg.org/\">CORBA</a>), writing new plugins is not always easy.</p>\n<p>This guide is intended to help you understand the GStreamer framework\nso you can develop new plugins to extend the existing\nfunctionality. The guide addresses most issues by following the\ndevelopment of an example plugin - an audio filter plugin - written in\nC. However, the later parts of the guide also present some issues\ninvolved in writing other types of plugins, and the end of the guide\ndescribes some of the Python bindings for GStreamer.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
