Inside them is are the actual element s that matters. There is several cases where this is useful. For example \nTo add support for private events with custom event handling to another element. \nTo add support for custom pad _query or _convert handling to another element. \nTo add custom data handling before or after another element s data handler function generally its _chain function \nTo embed an element or a series of elements into something that looks and works like a simple element to the outside world. This is particular handy for implementing sources and sink elements with multiple pads. \nMaking a manager is about as simple as it gets. You can derive from a GstBin and in most cases you can embed the required elements in the _init already including setup of ghostpads. If you need any custom data handlers you can connect signals or embed a second element which you control. \n"});
