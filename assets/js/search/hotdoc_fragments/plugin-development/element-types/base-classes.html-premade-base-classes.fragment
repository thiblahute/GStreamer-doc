Now let s assume that all you want is to create an simple audiosink that works exactly the same as say esdsink or a filter that simply normalizes audio volume. Such elements are very general in concept and since they do nothing special they should be easier to code than to provide your own scheduler activation functions and doing complex caps negotiation. For this purpose GStreamer provides base classes that simplify some types of elements. Those base classes will be discussed in this chapter. \n"});
