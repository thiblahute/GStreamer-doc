Audio sources would be anything that reads audio such as a source reading from a soundserver a kernel interface such as ALSA or a test sound signal generator. GStreamer provides two base classes similar to the two audiosinks described in Writing an audio sink one is ringbuffer based and requires the derived class to take care of its own scheduling synchronization and such. The other is based on this GstAudioBaseSrc and is called GstAudioSrc and provides a simple open close and read interface which is rather simple to implement and will suffice for most soundserver sources and audio interfaces e.g. ALSA or OSS out there. \nThe GstAudioSrc base class has several benefits for derived classes on top of the benefits of the GstPushSrc base class that it is based on \nDoes syncronization and provides a clock. \nNew features can be added to it and will apply to all derived classes automatically. \n"});
