This is a base class for elements with one sourcepad and one sinkpad which act as a filter of some sort such as volume changing audio resampling audio format conversion and so on and so on. There is quite a lot of bookkeeping that such elements need to do in order for things such as buffer allocation forwarding passthrough in place processing and such to all work correctly. This base class does all that for you so that you just need to do the actual processing. \nSince the GstBaseTransform is based on the to model for filters it may not apply well to elements such as decoders which may have to parse properties from the stream. Also it will not work for elements requiring more than one sourcepad or sinkpad. \n"});
