Currently it does nothing yet but add another compile dependency so derived classes will need to implement all base sink virtual functions. When they do this correctly this will have some positive effects on the end user experience with the videosink \nBecause of preroll and the preroll virtual function it is possible to display a video frame already when going into the GST_STATE_PAUSED state. \nBy adding new features to GstVideoSink it will be possible to add extensions to videosinks that affect all of them but only need to be coded once which is a huge maintenance benefit. \n"});
