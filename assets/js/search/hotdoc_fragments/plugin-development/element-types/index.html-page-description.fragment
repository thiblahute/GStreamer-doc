Most of this has been fairly low-level and\ngiven deep insights in how GStreamer works internally. Fortunately,\nGStreamer contains some easier-to-use interfaces to create such\nelements. In order to do that, we will look closer at the element types\nfor which GStreamer provides base classes (sources, sinks and\ntransformation elements). We will also look closer at some types of\nelements that require no specific coding such as scheduling-interaction\nor data passing, but rather require specific pipeline control (e.g.\nN-to-1 elements and managers).</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
