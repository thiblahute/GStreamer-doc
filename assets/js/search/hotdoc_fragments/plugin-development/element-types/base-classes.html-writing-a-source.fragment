This applies most definitely to source elements reading from a randomly seekable location such as file sources. However other source elements may be better described as a live source element such as a camera source an audio card source and such those are not seekable and do not provide byte exact access. For all such use cases GStreamer provides two base classes GstBaseSrc for the basic source functionality and GstPushSrc which is a non byte exact source base class. The pushsource base class itself derives from basesource as well and thus all statements about the basesource apply to the pushsource too. \nThe basesrc class does several things automatically for derived classes so they no longer have to worry about it \nFixes to GstBaseSrc apply to all derived classes automatically. \nAutomatic pad activation handling and task wrapping in case we get assigned to start a task ourselves. \nThe GstBaseSrc may not be suitable for all cases though it has limitations \nIt is possible to use special memory such as X server memory pointers or mmap ed memory areas as data pointers in buffers returned from the create virtual function. \n"});
