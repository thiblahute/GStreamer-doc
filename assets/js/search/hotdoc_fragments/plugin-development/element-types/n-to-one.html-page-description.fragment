The main noteworthy thing about N to elements is that each pad is push based in its own thread and the N to element synchronizes those streams by expected timestamp based logic. This means it lets all streams wait except for the one that provides the earliest next expected timestamp. When that stream has passed one buffer the next earliest expected timestamp is calculated and we start back where we were until all streams have reached EOS. There is a helper base class called GstCollectPads that will help you to do this. \nNote however that this helper class will only help you with grabbing a buffer from each input and giving you the one with earliest timestamp. If you need anything more difficult such as don t grab a new buffer until a given timestamp or something like that you ll need to do this yourself. \n"});
