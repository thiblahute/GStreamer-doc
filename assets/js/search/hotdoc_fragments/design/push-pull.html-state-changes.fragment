fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/push-pull.html#state-changes", "fragment": "State changes \nThe GstBin sets the state of all the sink elements. These are the elements without source pads. \nSetting the state on an element will first activate all the srcpads and then the sinkpads. For each of the sinkpads gst_pad_check_pull_range is performed. If the sinkpad supports a loopfunction and the peer pad returns TRUE from the GstPadCheckPullRange function then the peer pad is activated first as it must be in the right state to handle a _pull_range Note that the state change of the element is not yet performed just the activate function is called on the source pad. This means that elements that implement a getrange function must be prepared to get their activate function called before their state change function. \nElements that have multiple sinkpads that require all of them to operate in the same mode push pull can use the _check_pull_range on all their pads and can then remove the loop functions if one of the pads does not support pull based mode. \n"});
