Most sources have a limit on the rate at which they can deliver data which might be faster or slower than the consumption rate. This property however does not make them a live source. \nLet s look at some example sources. \nfile readers you can PAUSE without losing data. There is however a limit to how fast you can read from this source. This limit is usually much higher than the consumption rate. In some cases it might be slower an NFS share for example in which case you might need to use some buffering see buffering \nHTTP network element you can PAUSE without data loss. Depending on the available network bandwidth consumption rate might be higher than production rate in which case buffering should be used see buffering \naudio source pausing the audio capture will lead to lost data. this source is therefore definitely live. In addition an audio source will produce data at a fixed rate the samplerate Also depending on the buffersize this source will introduce a latency see latency \nudp network source Pausing the receiving part will lead to lost data. This source is therefore a live source. Also in a typical case the udp packets will be received at a certain rate which might be difficult to guess because of network jitter. This source does not necessarily introduce latency on its own. \ndvb source PAUSING this element will lead to data loss it s a live source similar to a UDP source. \n"});
