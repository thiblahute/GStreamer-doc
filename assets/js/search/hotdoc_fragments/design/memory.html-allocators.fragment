Allocators are a subclass of GstObject and can be subclassed to make custom allocators. \nThe allocator class has virtual methods. One to create a GstMemory another to free it. \nAllocators are refcounted. It is also possible to register the allocator to the GStreamer system. This way the allocator can be retrieved by name. \nAfter an allocator is created new GstMemory can be created with \nGstAllocationParams contain extra info such as flags alignment prefix and padding. \nThe GstMemory object is a refcounted object that must be freed with gst_memory_unref \nThe GstMemory keeps a ref to the allocator that allocated it. Inside the allocator are the most common GstMemory operations listed. Custom GstAllocator implementations must implement the various operations on the memory they allocate. \nIt is also possible to create a new GstMemory object that wraps existing memory with \n"});
