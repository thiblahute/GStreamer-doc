When it receives the event GstRTPRetransmissionRequest from the downstream gstrtpsession element it loopkup the requested seqnum in its stored packets. If the packet is present in its history it will create a RTX packet according to RFC Then this rtx packet is pushed to its src pad as other packets. \nrtprtxsend works in SSRC multiplexed mode so it has one always sink and src pad. \n"});
