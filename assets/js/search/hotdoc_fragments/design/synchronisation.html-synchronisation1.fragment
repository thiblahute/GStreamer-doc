Thus \nOne then waits for the clock to reach B.sync_time before rendering the buffer in the sink See also clocks \nFor multiple streams this means that buffers with the same running_time are to be displayed at the same time. \nA demuxer must make sure that the SEGMENT it emits on its output pads yield the same running_time for buffers that should be played synchronized. This usually means sending the same SEGMENT on all pads and making sure that the synchronized buffers have the same timestamps. \n"});
