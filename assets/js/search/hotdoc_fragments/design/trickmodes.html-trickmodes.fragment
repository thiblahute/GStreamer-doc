This includes \nserver side trickmodes \nclient side fast slow forward playback \nclient side fast slow backwards playback \nServer side trickmodes mean that a source network source can provide a stream with different playback speed and direction. The client does not have to perform any special algorithms to decode this stream. \nClient side trickmodes mean that the decoding client GStreamer performs the needed algorithms to change the direction and speed of the media file. \nSeeking can both be done in a playback pipeline and a transcoding pipeline. \n"});
