For example in a sequence of three telecined frames we might have \nIn this situation we only need the first and third buffers as the second buffer contains fields present in the first and third. \nNote that the following state can have its second buffer identified using the ONEFIELD flag and TFF not set \nThe telecine state requires one additional flag to be able to identify progressive buffers. \nThe presence of the GST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_INTERLACED means that the buffer is an interlaced or mixed buffer that contains two fields that when combined with fields from adjacent buffers allow reconstruction of progressive frames. The absence of the flag implies the buffer containing two fields is a progressive frame. \nFor example in the following sequence the third buffer would be mixed yes it is a strange pattern but it can happen \n"});
