This running_time represents the total time spent in the PLAYING state and is calculated as follows \nIf the pipeline is NULL READY the running_time is undefined. \nIn PAUSED the running_time remains at the time when it was last PAUSED. When the stream is PAUSED for the first time the running_time is \nIn PLAYING the running_time is the delta between the absolute_time and the base time. The base time is defined as the absolute_time minus the running_time at the time when the pipeline is set to PLAYING. \nafter a flushing seek the running_time is set to see seeking This is accomplished by redistributing a new base_time to the elements that got flushed. \nThis algorithm captures the running_time when the pipeline is set from PLAYING to PAUSED and restores this time based on the current absolute_time when going back to PLAYING. This allows for both clocks that progress when in the PAUSED state systemclock and clocks that don t audioclock \nThe clock and pipeline now provide a running_time to all elements that want to perform synchronisation. Indeed the running time can be observed in each element during the PLAYING state as \nWe note C.running_time as the running_time obtained by looking at the clock. This value is monotonically increasing at the rate of the clock. \n"});
