fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/probes.html#blocking-probes", "fragment": "Blocking probes \nBlocking probes are probes with BLOCK or IDLE flags set. They will always block the dataflow and trigger the callback according to the following rules \nWhen the IDLE flag is set the probe callback is called as soon as no data is flowing over the pad. If at the time of probe registration the pad is idle the callback will be called immediately from the current thread. Otherwise the callback will be called as soon as the pad becomes idle in the streaming thread. \nThe IDLE probe is useful to perform dynamic linking it allows to wait for for a safe moment when an unlink link operation can be done. Since the probe is a blocking probe it will also make sure that the pad stays idle until the probe is removed. \nWhen the BLOCK flag is set the probe callback will be called when new data arrives on the pad and right before the pad goes into the blocking state. This callback is thus only called when there is new data on the pad. \nThe blocking probe is removed with gst_pad_remove_probe or when the probe callback return GST_PAD_PROBE_REMOVE. In both cases and if this was the last blocking probe on the pad the pad is unblocked and dataflow can continue. \n"});
