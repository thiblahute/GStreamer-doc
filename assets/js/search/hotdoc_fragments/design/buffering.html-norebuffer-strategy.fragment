fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/buffering.html#norebuffer-strategy", "fragment": "No rebuffer strategy \nThis strategy tries to buffer as much data as possible so that playback can continue without any further rebuffering. \nThis strategy is initially similar to simple buffering the difference is in deciding on the condition to continue playback. When a buffering message has been received the application will not yet start the playback but it will start a periodic buffering query which will return the estimated amount of buffering time left. When the estimated time left is less than the remaining playback time playback can continue. \nThis strategy requires a unlimited buffer size in memory or on disk such as provided by elements that implement the incremental download buffering mode. \nUsually the application can choose to start playback even before the remaining buffer time elapsed in order to more quickly start the playback at the expense of a possible rebuffering phase. \n"});
