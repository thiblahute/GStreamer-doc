The width of the image in pixels. \nheight G_TYPE_INT Mandatory. The height of the image in pixels \nframerate GST_TYPE_FRACTION Default The framerate of the video for variable framerate \nmax framerate GST_TYPE_FRACTION Default as framerate. For variable framerates this would be the maximum expected framerate. This value is only valid when the framerate is set to variable \nviews G_TYPE_INT Default The number of views for multiview video. Each buffer contains multiple GstVideoMeta buffers that describe each view. use the frame id to get access to the different views. \ninterlace mode G_TYPE_STRING Default progressive. The interlace mode. The following values are possible \nprogressive all frames are progressive \ninterleaved fields are interleaved in one video frame. Extra buffer flags describe the field order. \nmixed progressive and interleaved frames extra buffer flags describe the frame and fields. \nfields fields are stored in one buffer. Use the frame ID to get access to the required field. For multiview the views property the fields of view N can be found at frame ID N and N Each view has only half the amount of lines as noted in the height property pads specifying the fields property must be prepared for this. This mode requires multiple GstVideoMeta metadata to describe the fields. \nchroma site G_TYPE_STRING Default GST_VIDEO_CHROMA_SITE_UNKNOWN. The chroma siting of the video frames. \ncolorimetry G_TYPE_STRING Default GST_VIDEO_COLORIMETRY_UNKNOWN. The colorimetry of the video frames. Predefined colorimetry is given with the following values \npixel aspect ratio GST_TYPE_FRACTION Default The pixel aspect ration of the video \nformat G_TYPE_STRING Mandatory. The format of the video. See the Formats section for a list of valid format strings. \nGstVideoMeta contains the description of one video field or frame. It has stride support and support for having multiple memory regions per frame. Multiple GstVideoMeta can be added to a buffer and can be identified with a unique id. This id can be used to select fields in interlaced formats or views in multiview formats. \nGstVideoCropMeta contains the cropping region of the video. \nYV12 planar YUV \nYVYU packed YUV \n"});
