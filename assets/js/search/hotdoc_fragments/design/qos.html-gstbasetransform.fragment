fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/qos.html#gstbasetransform", "fragment": "GstBaseTransform \nTransform elements can entirely skip the transform based on the timestamp and jitter values of recent QoS event since these buffers will certainly arrive too late. \nWith any intermediate element the element should measure its performance to decide if it is responsible for the quality problems or any upstream downstream element. \nsome transforms can reduce the complexity of their algorithms. Depending on the algorithm the changes in quality may have disturbing visual or audible effect that should be avoided. \nA QoS message should be posted when a frame is dropped or when the quality of the filter is reduced. The quality member in the QOS message should reflect the quality setting of the filter. \n"});
