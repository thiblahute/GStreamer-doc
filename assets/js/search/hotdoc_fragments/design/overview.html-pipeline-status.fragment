The bus is an object that the pipeline provides and that can be retrieved with gst_pipeline_get_bus \nThe bus can be polled or added to the glib mainloop. \nThe bus is distributed to all elements added to the pipeline. The elements use the bus to post messages on. Various message types exist such as ERRORS WARNINGS EOS STATE_CHANGED etc.. \nThe pipeline handles EOS messages received from elements in a special way. It will only forward the message to the application when all sink elements have posted an EOS message. \nOther methods for obtaining the pipeline status include the Query functionality that can be performed with gst_element_query on the pipeline. This type of query is useful for obtaining information about the current position and total time of the pipeline. It can also be used to query for the supported seeking formats and ranges. \n"});
