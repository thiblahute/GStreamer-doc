fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/preroll.html#preroll", "fragment": "Preroll \nA sink element can only complete the state change to PAUSED after a buffer has been queued on the input pad or pads. This process is called prerolling and is needed to fill the pipeline with buffers so that the transition to PLAYING goes as fast as possible with no visual delay for the user. \nPreroll is also crucial in maintaining correct audio and video synchronisation and ensuring that no buffers are dropped in the sinks. \nAfter receiving a buffer or EOS on a pad the chain event function should wait to render the buffers or in the EOS case wait to post the EOS message. While waiting the sink will wait for the preroll cond to be signalled. \nSeveral things can happen that require the preroll cond to be signalled. These include state changes or flush events. The prerolling is implemented in sinks see element sink \n"});
