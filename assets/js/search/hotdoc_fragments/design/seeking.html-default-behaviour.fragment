fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/seeking.html#default-behaviour", "fragment": "DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR \nWhen a seek to a certain position is requested the demuxer parser will do two things ignoring flushing and segment seeks and simplified for illustration purposes \nsend a segment event with a new start position \nstart pushing data buffers again \nTo ensure that the data corresponding to the requested seek position can actually be decoded a demuxer or parser needs to start pushing data from a keyframe keyunit at or before the requested seek position. \nUnless requested differently via the KEY_UNIT flag the start of the segment event should be the requested seek position. \nSo by default a demuxer parser will then start pushing data from position DATA and send a segment event with start position SEG_START and DATA SEG_START. \nIf DATA SEG_START a well behaved video decoder will start decoding frames from DATA but take into account the segment configured by the demuxer via the segment event and only actually output decoded video frames from SEG_START onwards dropping all decoded frames that are before the segment start and adjusting the timestamp duration of the buffer that overlaps the segment start clipping A not so well behaved video decoder will start decoding frames from DATA and push decoded video frames out starting from position DATA in which case the frames that are before the configured segment start will usually be dropped clipped downstream e.g. by the video sink \n"});
