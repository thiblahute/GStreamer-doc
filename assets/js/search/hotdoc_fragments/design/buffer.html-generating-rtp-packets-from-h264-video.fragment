We typically need to fragment the h264 data into multiple packets each with their own RTP and payload specific header. \nThe output buffer array consists of x buffers consisting of an RTP payload header and a subbuffer of the original input H264 buffer. Since the rtp headers and the h264 data don t need to be contiguous in memory they are added to the buffer as separate GstMemory blocks and we can avoid to memcpy the h264 data into contiguous memory. \nA typical udpsink will then use something like sendmsg to send the memory regions on the network inside one UDP packet. This will further avoid having to memcpy data into contiguous memory. \nUsing bufferlists the complete array of output buffers can be pushed in one operation to the peer element. \n"});
