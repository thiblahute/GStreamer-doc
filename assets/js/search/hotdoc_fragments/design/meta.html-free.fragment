In the case of the Memory metadata we need to call the associated free function to free the memory. \nWhen freeing a GstBuffer the custom buffer free function will iterate all of the metadata in the buffer and call the associated free functions in the MetaInfo associated with the entries. Usually this function will be NULL. \n"});
