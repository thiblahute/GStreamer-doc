These things below are not reflecting the current implementation. \nAll formats have table of cue id cue start cue end extra tags \nMany formats have metadata that references the cue table. loops in instruments in wav aifc edit lists in wav mp4 \nFor mp4.edtl wav.plst we could expose two editions. the edit list is flattened default for playback the stream has the raw data and the edit list is there as chapter markers useful for editing software \nWe might want to introduce a new GST_TOC_ENTRY_TYPE_MARKER or _CUE. This would be a sequence entry type and it would not be used for navigational purposes but to attach data to a point in time envelopes loops \nAPI wise there is some overlap between exposing multiple audio video tracks as pads or as ToC editions. For ToC editions we have the TocSelect event. exposing subtitles as a sparse stream or as as ToC sequence of markers with labels \n"});
