The actual bytes are not reversed. Each chunk that is not forward continuous with the previous chunk is marked with a DISCONT flag. \nA demuxer accumulates the chunks. As soon as a keyframe is found everything starting from the keyframe up to the accumulated data is sent downstream. Timestamps on the buffers are set starting from the stop position to start effectively going backwards. Chunks are marked with DISCONT when they are not forward continuous with the previous buffer. \nA video decoder decodes and accumulates all decoded frames. If a buffer with a DISCONT SEGMENT or EOS is received all accumulated frames are sent downsteam in reverse. \nAn audio decoder decodes and accumulates all decoded audio. If a buffer with a DISCONT SEGMENT or EOS is received all accumulated audio is sent downstream in reverse order. Some audio codecs need the previous data buffer to decode the current one in that case the previous DISCONT buffer needs to be combined with the last non DISCONT buffer to generate the last bit of output. \nA sink reverses for audio and retimestamps audio video the buffers before playing them back. Retimestamping occurs relative to the stop position making the timestamps increase again and suitable for synchronizing against the clock. Audio sinks also have to perform simple resampling before playing the samples. \nfor transcoding audio and video resamplers can be used to reverse resample and retimestamp the buffers. Any rate adjustments performed on the media must be added to the applied_rate and subtracted from the rate members in the SEGMENT event. \nIn SKIP mode the same algorithm as for forward SKIP mode can be used. \n"});
