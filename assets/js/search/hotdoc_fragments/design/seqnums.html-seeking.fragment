fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/seqnums.html#seeking", "fragment": "Seeking \nA seek event sent to the pipeline is forwarded to all sinks in it. These sinks then push the SEEK event upstream until they reach an element that is capable of handling it. If the element handling the seek has multiple source pads tipically a demuxer is handling the seek it might receive the same seek event on all pads. To prevent handling the same seek event multiple times the seqnum can be used to identify those events as being the same and only handle the one received first. \nAlso when handling the seek the element might push FLUSH_START FLUSH_STOP and a segment event. All these events should have the seqnum of the received seek event. When this segment is over and an EOS SEGMENT_DONE event is going to be pushed it should also have the seqnum of the seek that originated the segment to be played. \nHaving the same seqnum as the seek on the SEGMENT_DONE or EOS events is important for the application to identify that the segment requested by its seek has finished playing. \n"});
