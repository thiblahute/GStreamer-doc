When transcoding to a file we only want the TOC information that is relevant to the transcoded stream to be written into the file structure e.g. the chapters of the title being transcoded or possibly only chapters if only those have been selected for playback transcoding \nThis is why we may need to create two different TOCs for those two types of consumers. \nElements that extract TOC information should send TOC events downstream. \nLike with tags sinks will post a TOC message on the bus for the application with the global TOC once a global TOC event reaches the sink. \n"});
