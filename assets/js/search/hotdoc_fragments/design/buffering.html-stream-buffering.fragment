The buffer uses the watermarks as follows \nThe buffer element will post BUFFERING messages until the high watermark is hit. This instructs the application to keep the pipeline PAUSED which will eventually block the srcpad from pushing while data is prerolled in the sinks. \nWhen the high watermark is hit a BUFFERING message with will be posted which instructs the application to continue playback. \nWhen the low watermark is hit during playback the queue will start posting BUFFERING messages again making the application PAUSE the pipeline again until the high watermark is hit again. This is called the rebuffering stage. \nDuring playback the queue level will fluctuate between the high and low watermarks as a way to compensate for network irregularities. \nThis buffering method is usable when the demuxer operates in push mode. Seeking in the stream requires the seek to happen in the network source. It is mostly desirable when the total duration of the file is not known such as in live streaming or when efficient seeking is not possible required. \n"});
