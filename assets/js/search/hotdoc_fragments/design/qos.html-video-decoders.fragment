A typical codec can for example skip the decoding of B frames to reduce the CPU usage and framerate. \nIf each frame is independantly decodable any arbitrary frame can be skipped based on the timestamp and jitter values of the latest QoS event. In addition can the proportion member be used to permanently skip frames. \nIt is suggested to adjust the quality field of the QoS message with the expected amount of dropped frames skipping B and or P frames This depends on the particular spacing of B and P frames in the stream. If the quality control would result in half of the frames to be dropped typical B frame skipping the quality field would be set to If a typical I frame spacing of frames is used skipping B and P frames would result in dropped frames or decoded frame every frames. The quality member should be set to \nskipping B frames quality \nskipping P B frames quality for I frame spacing of frames \n"});
