fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/MT-refcounting.html#object-locking", "fragment": "Object locking \nFor objects that contain state information and generally have a longer lifetime object locking is used to update the information contained in the object. \nAll readers and writers acquire the lock before accessing the object. Only one thread is allowed access the protected structures at a time. \nObject locking is used for all objects extending from GstObject such as GstElement GstPad. \nObject locking can be done with recursive locks or regular mutexes. Object locks in GStreamer are implemented with mutexes which cause deadlocks when locked recursively from the same thread. This is done because regular mutexes are cheaper. \n"});
