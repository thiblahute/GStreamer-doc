fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/qos.html#qualityofservice", "fragment": "Quality of Service \nQuality of service is about measuring and adjusting the real time performance of a pipeline. \nThe real time performance is always measured relative to the pipeline clock and typically happens in the sinks when they synchronize buffers against the clock. \nThe measurements result in QOS events that aim to adjust the datarate in one or more upstream elements. Two types of adjustments can be made \nshort time emergency corrections based on latest observation in the sinks. \nlong term rate corrections based on trends observed in the sinks. \nIt is also possible for the application to artificially introduce delay between synchronized buffers this is called throttling. It can be used to reduce the framerate for example. \n"});
