That s why rtprtxsend works in SSRC multiplexed mode. It also means that the same session is used. Another difference between rtx packet and its original is that it inserts the original seqnum OSN bytes at the beginning of the payload. Also rtprtxsend builds rtx packet without padding to let other elements do that. The last difference is the payload type. For now the user has to set it through the rtx payload type property. Later it will be automatically retreive this information from SDP. See fmtp field as specifies in the RPC4588 a fmtp apt fmtp is the payload type of the retransmission stream and apt the payload type of its associated master stream. \n"});
