All the sources in the pipeline will have their send_event handlers called and will receive the event from the application. \nWhen handling this event the sources will push either the same EOS downstream or create their own EOS event and push. In the later case the source should copy the seqnum from the original EOS to the newly created one. This same logic applies to all elements that receive the EOS downstream either push the same event or if creating a new one copy the seqnum. \nWhen the EOS reaches the sink it will create an EOS message copy the seqnum to the message and post to the bus. The application receives the message and can compare its seqnum with the one from the original event sent to the pipeline. If they match it knows that this EOS message was caused by the event it pushed and not from other reason input finished or configured segment was over \n"});
