fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/live-source.html#latency", "fragment": "Latency \nThe live source timestamps its data with the time of the clock when the data was captured. Normally it will take some time to capture the first sample of data and the last one. This means that when the buffer arrives at the sink it will already be late and will be dropped. \nThe latency is the time it takes to construct one buffer of data and it s exposed with a LATENCY query. \nSee latency \n"});
