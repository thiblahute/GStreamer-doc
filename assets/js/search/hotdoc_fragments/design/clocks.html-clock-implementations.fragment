Asynchronous callbacks are scheduled from an internal thread. \nClock implementers are encouraged to subclass this systemclock as it implements the async notification. \nSubclasses can however override all of the important methods for sync and async notifications to implement their own callback methods or blocking wait operations. \n"});
