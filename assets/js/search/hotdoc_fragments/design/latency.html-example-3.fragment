The total latency should be that of vsink. \nNote that because of the presence of a live source vsrc the pipeline can be set to playing before the sink is able to preroll. Without compensation for the live source this might lead to synchronisation problems because the latency should be configured in the element before it can go to PLAYING. \n"});
