We need to be able to specify the data on a buffer using multiple pointers in memory. We also need to be able to specify the stride for these planes. \nExtra buffer data Some elements might need to store extra data for a buffer. This is typically done when the resources are allocated from another subsystem such as OMX or X11. \nProcessing information Pan and crop information can be added to the buffer data when the downstream element can understand and use this metadata. An imagesink can for example use the pan and cropping information when blitting the image on the screen with little overhead. \n"});
