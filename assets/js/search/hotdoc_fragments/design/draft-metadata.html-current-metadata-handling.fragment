It will be sent a GST_EVENT_TAG to downstream elements. When a sink element receives a tag event it will post a GST_MESSAGE_TAG message on the bus with the contents of the tag event. \nElements receiving GST_EVENT_TAG events can mangle them mux them into the buffers they send or just pass them through. Usually is muxers that will format the tag data into the form required by the format they mux. Such elements would also implement the GstTagSetter interface to receive tags from the application. \nThe data used in all those interfaces is GstTagList. It is based on a GstStructure which is like a hash table with differently typed entries. The key is always a string GQuark. Many keys are predefined in GStreamer core. More keys are defined in gst plugins base gst libs gst tag tag.h. If elements and applications use predefined types it is possible to transcode a file from one format into another while preserving all known and mapped metadata. \n"});
