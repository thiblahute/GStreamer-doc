fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/meta.html#relationship-with-gstcaps", "fragment": "Relationship with GstCaps \nThe difference between GstCaps used in negotiation and the metadata is not clearly defined. \nWe would like to think of the GstCaps containing the information needed to functionally negotiate the format between two elements. The Metadata should then only contain variables that can change between each buffer. \nFor example for video we would have width height framerate in the caps but then have the more technical details such as stride data pointers pan crop zoom etc in the metadata. \nA scheme like this would still allow us to functionally specify the desired video resolution while the implementation details would be inside the metadata. \n"});
