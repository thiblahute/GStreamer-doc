It is NOT allowed to hold the child lock before taking the parent lock. \nThis policy allows for parents to iterate their children and setting properties on them. \nWhenever a nested lock needs to be taken on objects not involved in a parent child relation eg. pads an explictic locking order has to be defined. \n"});
