fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/clocks.html#clock-selection", "fragment": "Clock Selection \nTo synchronize the different elements the GstPipeline is responsible for selecting and distributing a global GstClock for all the elements in it. \nThis selection happens whenever the pipeline goes to PLAYING. Whenever an element is added removed from the pipeline this selection will be redone in the next state change to PLAYING. Adding an element that can provide a clock will post a GST_MESSAGE_CLOCK_PROVIDE message on the bus to inform parent bins of the fact that a clock recalculation is needed. \nWhen a clock is selected a NEW_CLOCK message is posted on the bus signaling the clock to the application. \nWhen the element that provided the clock is removed from the pipeline a CLOCK_LOST message is posted. The application must then set the pipeline to PAUSED and PLAYING again in order to let the pipeline select a new clock and distribute a new base time. \nThe clock selection is performed as part of the state change from PAUSED to PLAYING and is described in states. \n"});
