We capture both audio and video and have them played back synchronized again. \nThe state changes happen in the same way as example Both sinks end up with pending state of PLAYING and a return value of ASYNC until they receive the first buffer. \nFor audio and video to be played in sync both sinks must compensate for the latency of its source but must also use exactly the same latency correction. \nSuppose asrc has a latency of ms and vsrc a latency of ms the total latency in the pipeline has to be at least ms. This also means that the pipeline must have at least a ms buffering on the audio stream or else the audio src will underrun while the audiosink waits for the previous sample to play. \n"});
