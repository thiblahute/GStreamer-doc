This can happens as we don t map all metadata fields to generic ones. \nWe should probably also add the whole metadata blob to the GstTagList. We would need a GST_TAG_SYSTEM_xxx define e.g. GST_TAG_SYSTEM_ID3V2 for each standard. The content is not printable and should be treated as binary if not known. The tag is not mergeable call gst_tag_register with GstTagMergeFunc NULL. Also the tag data is only useful for upstream elements not for the application. \nA muxer would first scan a taglist for known system tags. Unknown tags are ignored as already. It would first populate its own metadata store with the entries from the system tag and the update the entries with the data in normal tags. \nBelow is an initial list of tag systems ID3V1 GST_TAG_SYSTEM_ID3V1 ID3V2 GST_TAG_SYSTEM_ID3V2 RIFF_INFO GST_TAG_SYSTEM_RIFF_INFO XMP GST_TAG_SYSTEM_XMP \nWe would basically need this for each container format. \nSee also https bugzilla.gnome.org show_bug.cgi id \n"});
