The nearest key frame may be before or after the requested seek position but many implementations will only look for the closest keyframe before the requested position. \nMost media players and thumbnailers do and should be doing KEY_UNIT seeks by default for performance reasons to ensure almost instant responsiveness when scrubbing dragging the seek slider in PAUSED or PLAYING mode This works well for most media but results in suboptimal behaviour for a small number of odd files e.g. files that only have one keyframe at the very beginning or only a few keyframes throughout the entire stream At the time of writing a solution for this still needs to be found but could be implemented demuxer parser side e.g. make demuxers parsers ignore the KEY_UNIT flag if the position adjustment would be larger than th of the duration or somesuch. \nFlags can be used to influence snapping direction for those cases where it matters. SNAP_BEFORE will select the preceding position to the seek target and SNAP_AFTER will select the following one. If both flags are set the nearest one to the seek target will be used. If none of these flags are set the seeking implemention is free to select whichever it wants. \n"});
