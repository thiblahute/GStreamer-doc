This class is mostly useful for elements that cannot do random access or at least very slowly. The source usually prefers to push out a fixed size buffer. \nClasses extending this base class will usually be scheduled in a push based mode. If the peer accepts to operate without offsets and within the limits of the allowed block size this class can operate in getrange based mode automatically. \nThe subclass should extend the methods from the baseclass in addition to the create method. If the source is seekable it needs to override GstBaseSrc event in addition to GstBaseSrc is_seekable in order to retrieve the seek offset which is the offset of the next buffer to be requested. \nFlushing scheduling and sync is all handled by this base class. \n"});
