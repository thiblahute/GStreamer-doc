Before to send the current master stream packet rtprtxsend sends all the buffers which are in this GQueue. Taking care of converting them to rtx packets. This way rtx packets are sent in the same order they have been requested. g_list_foreach traverse the queue from head to tail The GQueue is cleared between sending master stream packets. So for this GQueue to contain more than one element it means that rtprtxsend receives more than one rtx request between sending master packets. \n"});
