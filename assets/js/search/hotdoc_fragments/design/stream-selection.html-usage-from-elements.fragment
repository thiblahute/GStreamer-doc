fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/stream-selection.html#usage-from-elements", "fragment": "Usage from elements \nWhen a demuxer knows the list of streams it can expose it creates a new GstStream for each stream it can provide with the appropriate information stream id flag tags caps \nThe demuxer then creates a GstStreamCollection object in which it will put the list of GstStream it can expose. That collection is then both posted on the bus via a GST_MESSAGE_COLLECTION and on each pad via a GST_EVENT_STREAM_COLLECTION \nThat new collection must be posted on the bus before the changes are made available. i.e. before pads corresponding to that selection are added removed. \nIn order to be backwards compatible and support elements that don t create streams collection yet the new parsebin element used by decodebin3 will automatically create those if not provided. \n"});
