This should not be confused with asynchronous state changes. \nWe accommodate for the following requirements \nApplication is informed when an async operation starts and completes. \nIt should be possible for the application to generically detect common operations and incorporate their progress into the GUI. \nApplications can cancel pending operations by doing regular state changes. \nApplications should be able to wait for completion of async operations. \nWe allow for the following scenarios \nElements want to inform the application about asynchronous DNS lookups and pending network requests. This includes starting and completing the lookup. \nElements opening devices and resources asynchronously. \nApplications having more freedom to implement timeout and cancelation of operations that currently block the state changes or happen invisibly behind the scenes. \n"});
