fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/push-pull.html#pushpull", "fragment": "push pull \nNormally a source element will push data to the downstream element using the gst_pad_push method. The downstream peer pad will receive the buffer in the Chain function. In the push mode the source element is the driving force in the pipeline as it initiates data transport. \nIt is also possible for an element to pull data from an upstream element. The downstream element does this by calling gst_pad_pull_range on one of its sinkpads. In this mode the downstream element is the driving force in the pipeline as it initiates data transfer. \nIt is important that the elements are in the correct state to handle a push or a pull_range from the peer element. For push based elements this means that all downstream elements should be in the correct state and for pull_range based elements this means the upstream elements should be in the correct state. \nMost sinkpads implement a chain function. This is the most common case. sinkpads implementing a loop function will be the exception. Likewise srcpads implementing a getrange function will be the exception. \n"});
