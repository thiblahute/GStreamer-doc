fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/segments.html#segments", "fragment": "Segments \nA segment in GStreamer denotes a set of media samples that must be processed. A segment has a start time a stop time and a processing rate. \nA media stream has a start and a stop time. The start time is always and the stop time is the total duration or if unknown for example a live stream We call this the complete media stream. \nThe segment of the complete media stream can be played by issuing a seek on the stream. The seek has a start time a stop time and a processing rate. \nThe playback of a segment starts with a source or demuxer element pushing a SEGMENT event containing the start time stop time and rate of the segment. The purpose of this event is to inform downstream elements of the requested segment positions. Some elements might produce buffers that fall outside of the segment and that might therefore be discarded or clipped. \n"});
