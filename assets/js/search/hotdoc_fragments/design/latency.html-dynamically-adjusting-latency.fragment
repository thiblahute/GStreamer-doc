This message instructs the pipeline to \nquery the latency in the pipeline which might now have changed with a LATENCY query. \nredistribute a new global latency to all elements with a LATENCY event. \nA use case where the latency in a pipeline can change could be a network element that observes an increased inter packet arrival jitter or excessive packet loss and decides to increase its internal buffering and thus the latency The element must post a LATENCY message and perform the additional latency adjustments when it receives the LATENCY event from the downstream peer element. \nIn a similar way the latency can be decreased when network conditions improve. \nLatency adjustments will introduce playback glitches in the sinks and must only be performed in special conditions. \n"});
