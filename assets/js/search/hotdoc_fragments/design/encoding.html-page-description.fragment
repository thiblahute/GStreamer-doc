The DAR Display Aspect Ratio MUST be respected. If needed black borders can be added to comply with the target DAR. framerate format colorspace depth All of this is done with a colorspace converter \nAn encoder with some optional settings is used. \nA muxer with some optional settings is used. \nThis is roughly the same as for raw video expect for \nWe modify the various fundamental properties of a raw audio stream to be compatible with the intersection of The encoder GstCaps and The specified Stream Restriction of the profile target \nThe fundamental properties that can be modifier are Number of channels Type of raw audio integer or floating point Depth number of bits required to encode one sample \nSteps and are replaced by a parser if a parser is available for the given format. \nOther streams will just be forwarded as is to the muxer provided the muxer accepts the stream type. \nThis is already provided by GstPbUtils. \nWhen an application wishes to use a Profile it should be able to query whether it has all the needed plugins to use it. \nThis part will use GstPbUtils to query and if needed install the missing plugins through the installed distribution plugin installer. \nThe requirement is to have lossless \n"});
