fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/buffer.html#managing-gstmemory", "fragment": "Managing GstMemory \nA GstBuffer contains an array of pointers to GstMemory objects. \nWhen the buffer is writable gst_buffer_insert_memory can be used to add a new GstMemory object to the buffer. When the array of memory is full memory will be merged to make room for the new memory object. \ngst_buffer_n_memory is used to get the amount of memory blocks on the GstBuffer. \nWith gst_buffer_peek_memory memory can be retrieved from the memory array. The desired access pattern for the memory block should be specified so that appropriate checks can be made and in case of GST_MAP_WRITE a writable copy can be constructed when needed. \ngst_buffer_remove_memory_range and gst_buffer_remove_memory can be used to remove memory from the GstBuffer. \n"});
