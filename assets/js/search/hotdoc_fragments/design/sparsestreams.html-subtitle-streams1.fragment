For example every time the SCR in MPEG data advances more than seconds the MPEG demuxer can issue a SEGMENT with update TRUE start SCR Downstream elements can then be aware not to expect any data older than the new start time. \nThe same holds true for any element that knows the current position in the stream once the element knows that there is no more data to be presented until time n it can advance the start time of the current segment to n \nThis technique can also be used for example to represent a stream of MIDI events spaced to a clock period. When there is no event present for a clock time a SEGMENT update can be sent in its place. \n"});
