fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/audiosinks.html#getrange-based-mode", "fragment": "getrange based mode \nIn getrange based mode the audiobasesink will use the callback function of the ringbuffer to get a segsize samples from the peer element. These samples will then be placed in the ringbuffer at the next play position. It is assumed that the getrange function returns fast enough to fill the ringbuffer before the play pointer reaches the write pointer. \nIn this mode the ringbuffer is usually kept as empty as possible. There is no context switch needed between the elements that create the samples and the actual writing of the samples to the device. \n"});
