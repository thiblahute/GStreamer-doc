fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/miniobject.html#exclusive-counter", "fragment": "exclusive counter \nEach object that wants to keep a reference to a GstMiniObject and doesn t want to see the changes from other owners of the same GstMiniObject needs to lock the GstMiniObject in EXCLUSIVE mode which will increase the exclusive counter. \nThe exclusive counter counts the amount of objects that share this GstMiniObject. The counter is initially meaning that the object is not shared with any object. \nWhen a reference to a GstMiniObject release both the ref count and the exclusive counter will be decreased with gst_mini_object_unref and gst_mini_object_unlock respectively. \n"});
