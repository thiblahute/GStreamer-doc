The output buffer is guaranteed to be writable and different from the input buffer. \ntransform_ip Transform the input buffer in place. The input buffer is writable and of bigger or equal size than the output buffer. \nA transform can operate in the following modes \npassthrough The element will not make changes to the buffers buffers are pushed straight through caps on both sides need to be the same. The element can optionally implement a transform_ip function to take a look at the data the buffer does not have to be writable. \nin place Changes can be made to the input buffer directly to obtain the output buffer. The transform must implement a transform_ip function. \ncopy transform The transform is performed by copying and transforming the input buffer to a new output buffer. The transform must implement a transform function. \nWhen no transform function is provided only in place and passthrough operation is allowed this means that source and destination caps must be equal or that the source buffer size is bigger or equal than the destination buffer. \nWhen no transform_ip function is provided only passthrough and copy transforms are supported. Providing this function is an optimisation that can avoid a buffer copy. \nWhen no functions are provided we can only process in passthrough mode. \n"});
