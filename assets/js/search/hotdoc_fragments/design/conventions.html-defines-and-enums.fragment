fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/conventions.html#defines-and-enums", "fragment": "defines and enums \nValues and macros defined as enums and preprocessor macros will be referred to in all capitals as per their definition. This includes object flags and element states as well as general enums. Examples are the states NULL READY PLAYING and PAUSED the element flags LOCKED_STATE and state return values SUCCESS FAILURE and ASYNC. Where there is a prefix as in the element flags it is usually dropped and implied. Note however that element flags should be cross checked with the header as there are currently two conventions in use with and without FLAGS in the middle. \n"});
