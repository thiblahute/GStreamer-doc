If this is a rtx packet then it recontructs the original and pushs the result to src pad as if it was a master packet. \nIf the ssrc is not yet associated rtprtxreceive checks the payload type. if the packet has its payload type marked as rtx then it will extract the OSN original seqnum number and lookup in its stored requests if a seqnum matchs. If found then it associates the current ssrc to the master ssrc marked in the request. If not found it just drops the packet. Then it removes the request from the stored requests. \nIf there are requests with the same seqnum and different ssrc then the couple seqnum ssrc is removed from the stored requests. A stored request actually means that actually the couple seqnum ssrc is stored. If it s happens the request is droped but it avoids to do bad associations. In this case the association is just delayed to the next request. \n"});
