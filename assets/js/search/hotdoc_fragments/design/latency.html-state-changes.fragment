fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/latency.html#state-changes", "fragment": "State Changes \nA sink is never set to PLAYING before it is prerolled. In order to do this the pipeline at the GstBin level keeps track of all elements that require preroll the ones that return ASYNC from the state change These elements posted an ASYNC_START message without a matching ASYNC_DONE one. \nThe pipeline will not change the state of the elements that are still doing an ASYNC state change. \nWhen an ASYNC element prerolls it commits its state to PAUSED and posts an ASYNC_DONE message. The pipeline notices this ASYNC_DONE message and matches it with the ASYNC_START message it cached for the corresponding element. \nWhen all ASYNC_START messages are matched with an ASYNC_DONE message the pipeline proceeds with setting the elements to the final state again. \nThe base time of the element was already set by the pipeline when it changed the NO_PREROLL element to PLAYING. This operation has to be performed in the separate async state change thread like the one currently used for going from PAUSED PLAYING in a non live pipeline \n"});
