fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/events.html#sink-pads", "fragment": "sink pads \nA gst_pad_send_event on a sinkpad will call the event function on the pad. If the event function returns success the sticky event is stored in the sticky event array and the event is marked for update. \nWhen the pad is flushing the _send_event function returns FALSE immediately. \nWhen the next data item is pushed the pending events are pushed first. \nThis ensures that the event function is never called for flushing pads and that the sticky array only contains events for which the event function returned success. \n"});
