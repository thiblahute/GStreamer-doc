They are used to identify a group of events and messages as being part of the same operation over the pipeline. \nWhenever a new event or message is created a seqnum is set into them. This seqnum is created from an ever increasing source starting from but it might wrap around so each new event and message gets a new and hopefully unique seqnum. \nSuppose an element receives an event A and as part of the logic of handling the event A creates a new event B. B should have its seqnum be the same as A because they are part of the same operation. The same logic applies if this element had to create multiple events or messages all of those should have the seqnum set to the value on the received event. For example when a sink element receives an EOS event and creates a new EOS message to post it should copy the seqnum from the event to the message because the EOS message is a consequence of the EOS event being received. \nPreserving the seqnums accross related events and messages allows the elements and applications to identify a set of events messages as being part of a single operation on the pipeline. For example flushes segments and EOS that are related to a seek event started by the application. \nSeqnums are also useful for elements to discard duplicated events avoiding handling them again. \n"});
