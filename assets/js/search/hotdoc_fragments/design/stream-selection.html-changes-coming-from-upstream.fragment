Let s assume a change in video codec and or PID. \nThe demuxer creates a new GstStream for the changed new stream creates a new GstStreamCollection for the updated PMT and posts it. \nDecodebin sees the new GstStreamCollection message. \nThe demuxer and parsebin then adds and removes pads. \nEventually the stream that switched will be decoded and output through the same pad as the previous video stream in a gapless fashion. \n"});
