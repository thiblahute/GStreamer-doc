In contrast to the seek event it operates very closely to the sink and thus has a very low latency and is not slowed down by queues and does not actually perform any seeking logic. For this reason we want to include a new API instead of reusing the seek API. \nThe following requirements are needed \nThe ability to walk forwards and backwards in the stream. \nArbitrary increments in any supported format time frames bytes \nHigh speed minimal overhead. This mechanism is not more expensive than simple playback. \nswitching between forwards and backwards stepping should be fast. \nMaintain synchronisation between streams. \nGet feedback of the amount of skipped data. \nAbility to play a certain amount of data at an arbitrary speed. \nWe want a system where we can step frames in PAUSED as well as play short segments of data in PLAYING. \n"});
