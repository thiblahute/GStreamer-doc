The non live source is connected to a live sink and the live source to a non live sink. \nThe state changes happen in the same way as example Sink will be able to preroll commit its state to PAUSED files will not be able to preroll. \nsink will have no latency since it is not connected to a live source. files does not do synchronisation so it does not care about latency. \nThe total latency in the pipeline is The vsrc captures in sync with the playback in sink. \nAs in example sink can only be set to PLAYING after it successfully prerolled. \n"});
