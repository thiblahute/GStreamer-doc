When the user asks for rtpbin.send_rtp_sink_i rtpbin will lookup in its second map key session id value aux send element If there is one aux element then it will set the sink pad of this aux sender element to be the ghost pad rtpbin.send_rtp_sink_i that the user asked. rtpbin will also request a src pad of this aux element to connect it to gstrtpsession_i. It will automatically create rtpbin.send_rtp_src_i the usuall way. Then if the user asks rtpbin.send_rtp_src_k then rtpbin will also lookup in that map and request another source pad of the aux element and connect it to the new gstrtpsession_k. \n"});
