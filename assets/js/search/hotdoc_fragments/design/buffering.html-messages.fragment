When the percentage field in the BUFFERING message is buffering is done. Values less than mean that buffering is in progress. \nThe BUFFERING message should be intercepted and acted upon by the application. The message contains at least one field that is sufficient for basic functionality \nSeveral more clever ways of dealing with the buffering messages can be used when in incremental or timeshifting download mode. For this purpose additional fields are added to the buffering message \nbuffering mode GST_TYPE_BUFFERING_MODE enum stream download timeshift live Buffering mode in use. See above for an explanation of the different alternatives. This field can be used to let the application have more control over the buffering process. \navg in rate G_TYPE_INT Average input buffering speed in bytes second. is unknown. This is the average number of bytes per second that is received on the buffering element input sink pads. It is a measurement of the network speed in most cases. \navg out rate G_TYPE_INT Average consumption speed in bytes second. is unknown. This is the average number of bytes per second that is consumed by the downstream element of the buffering element. \nbuffering left G_TYPE_INT64 Estimated time that buffering will take in milliseconds. is unknown. This is measured based on the avg in rate and the filled level of the queue. The application can use this hint to update the GUI about the estimated remaining time that buffering will take. \n"});
