fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/orc-integration.html#about-orc", "fragment": "About Orc \nOrc code can be in one of two forms in orc files that is converted by orcc to C code that calls liborc functions or C code that calls liborc to create complex operations at runtime. The former is mostly for functions with predetermined functionality. The latter is for functionality that is determined at runtime where writing orc functions for all combinations would be prohibitive. Orc also has a fast memcpy and memset which are useful independently. \n"});
