fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/orc-integration.html#fast-memcpy", "fragment": "Fast memcpy \nThis part is not integrated yet. \nOrc has built in functions orc_memcpy and orc_memset that work like memcpy and memset These are meant for large copies only. A reasonable cutoff for using orc_memcpy instead of memcpy is if the number of bytes is generally greater than DO NOT use orc_memcpy if the typical is size is less than bytes especially if the size is known at compile time as these cases are inlined by the compiler. \nExample sys ximage ximagesink.c \nAdd ORC_CFLAGS to libgstximagesink_la_CFLAGS and ORC_LIBS to libgstximagesink_la_LIBADD. Then in the source file add \nifdef HAVE_ORC include orc orc.h else define orc_memcpy a b c memcpy a b c endif \nThen switch relevant uses of memcpy to orc_memcpy \nThe above example works whether or not Orc is enabled at compile time. \n"});
