fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/gstbin.html#duration", "fragment": "DURATION \nWhen a DURATION query is performed on a bin it will forward the query to all its sink elements. The bin will calculate the total duration as the MAX of all returned durations and will then cache the result so that any further queries can use the cached version. The reason for caching the result is because the duration of a stream typically does not change that often. \nA GST_MESSAGE_DURATION_CHANGED posted by an element will clear the cached duration value so that the bin will query the sinks again. This message is typically posted by elements that calculate the duration of the stream based on some average bitrate which might change while playing the stream. The DURATION_CHANGED message is posted to the application which can then fetch the updated DURATION. \n"});
