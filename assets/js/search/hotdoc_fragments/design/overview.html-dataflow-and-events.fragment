Unlike the buffers events can pass both upstream and downstream. Some events only travel upstream others only downstream. \nThe events are used to denote special conditions in the dataflow such as EOS or to inform plugins of special events such as flushing or seeking. \nSome events must be serialized with the buffer flow others don t. Serialized events are inserted between the buffers. Non serialized events jump in front of any buffers current being processed. \nAn example of a serialized event is a TAG event that is inserted between buffers to mark metadata for those buffers. \nAn example of a non serialized event is the FLUSH event. \n"});
