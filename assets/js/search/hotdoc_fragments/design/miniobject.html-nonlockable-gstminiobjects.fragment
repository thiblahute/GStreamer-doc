They use the refcount value to control writability of the object. \nWhen the refcount of the miniobject is the objects it referenced by at least objects and is thus considered unwritable. A copy must be made before a modification to the object can be done. \nUsing the refcount to control writability is problematic for many language bindings that can keep additional references to the objects. This method is mainly for historical reasons until all users of the miniobjects are converted to use the LOCKABLE flag. \n"});
