fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/qos.html#long-term-correction", "fragment": "Long term correction \nThe datarate used to calculate for the short term prediction is based on a single observation. A more accurate datarate can be obtained by creating a running average over multiple datarate observations. \nThis average is less susceptible to sudden changes that would only influence the datarate for a very short period. \nA running average is calculated over the observations given in and is used as the proportion member in the QoS event that is sent upstream. \nReceivers of the QoS event should permanently reduce their datarate as given by the proportion member. Failure to do so will certainly lead to more dropped frames and a generally worse QoS. \n"});
