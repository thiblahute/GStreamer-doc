It contains the following fields. \nactive If the step was queued or activated. \nformat GST_TYPE_FORMAT The format of the step units that queued activated. \namount G_TYPE_UINT64 The amount of units that were queued activated. \nrate G_TYPE_DOUBLE The rate and direction at which the frames were queued activated. \nflush G_TYPE_BOOLEAN If the queued activated frames will be flushed. \nintermediate G_TYPE_BOOLEAN If this is an intermediate step operation that queued activated. \nThe STEP_START message is emitted times \nfirst when an element received the STEP event and queued it. The active field will be FALSE in this case. \nsecond when the step operation started in the streaming thread. The active field is TRUE in this case. After this message is emitted the application can queue a new step operation. \nThe purpose of this message is to find out how many elements participate in the step operation and to queue new step operations at the earliest possible moment. \nA new GST_MESSAGE_STEP_DONE message is created. It contains the following fields \nThe message is emitted by the element that performs the step operation. The purpose is to return the duration in GST_FORMAT_TIME of the stepped media. This especially interesting to align other stream in case of stepping frames on the video sink element. \n"});
