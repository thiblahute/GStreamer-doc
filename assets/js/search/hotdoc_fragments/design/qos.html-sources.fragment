fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/qos.html#sources", "fragment": "Sources \nThe QoS events only apply to push based sources since pull based sources are entirely controlled by another downstream element. \nSources can receive a overflow or underflow event that can be used to switch to less demanding source material. In case of a network stream a switch could be done to a lower or higher quality stream or additional enhancement layers could be used or ignored. \nLive sources will automatically drop data when it takes too long to process the data that the element pushes out. \nLive sources should post a QoS message when data is dropped. \n"});
