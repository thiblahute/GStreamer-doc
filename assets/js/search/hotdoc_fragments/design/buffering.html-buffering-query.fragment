We also want to be able to present the user with information about the downloaded range in the file so that the GUI can react on it. \nIn addition to all the fields present in the buffering message the BUFFERING query contains the following field which indicates the available downloaded range in a specific format and the estimated time to complete \nbusy G_TYPE_BOOLEAN if buffering was busy.

When the size of the downloaded file is known this value will contain the latest estimate of the remaining download time of the currently downloading range. This value is usually only filled for the download buffering mode. The application can use this information to estimate the amount of remaining time to download till the end of the file. \nbuffering ranges G_TYPE_ARRAY of GstQueryBufferingRange contains optionally the downloaded areas in the format given above. One of the ranges contains the same start stop position as above \nFor the download and timeshift buffering modes the start and stop positions specify the ranges where efficient seeking in the downloaded media is possible. Seeking outside of these ranges might be slow or not at all possible. \nFor the stream and live mode the start and stop values describe the oldest and newest item expressed in format in the buffer. \n"});
