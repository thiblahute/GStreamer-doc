fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/orc-integration.html#audioconvert", "fragment": "audioconvert \nOrc doesn t have a mechanism for generating random numbers which prevents its use as is for dithering. One way around this is to generate suitable dithering values in one pass then use those values in a second Orc based pass. \nOrc doesn t handle bit float for no good reason. \nIrrespective of Orc handling bit float it would be useful to have a direct bit float to bit integer conversion. \naudioconvert is a good candidate for programmatically generated Orc code. \naudioconvert enumerates functions in terms of big endian vs. little endian. Orc s functions are native and swapped Programmatically generating code removes the need to worry about this. \nOrc doesn t handle bit samples. Fixing this is not a priority for ds \n"});
