Since by default it is configured to only expose a stream of each type it will pick a stream of each for which it will complete the auto plugging finding a decoder and then exposing that stream as a source ghostpad. \nNote If the demuxer doesn t create post the GstStreamCollection parsebin will create it on itself as explained in section above. \n"});
