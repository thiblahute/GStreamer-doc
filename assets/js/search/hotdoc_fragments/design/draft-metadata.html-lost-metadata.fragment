fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/draft-metadata.html#lost-metadata", "fragment": "Lost metadata \nA case slighly different from the previous is that when an application sets a GstTagList on a pipeline. Right elements consuming tags do not report which tags have been consumed. Especially when using elements that make metadata persistent we have no means of knowing which of the tags made it into the target stream and which were not serialized. Ideally the application would like to know which kind of metadata is accepted by a pipleine to reflect that in the UI. \nAlthough it is in practise so that elements implementing GstTagSetter are the ones that serialize this does not have to be so. Otherwise we could add a means to that interface where elements add the tags they have serialized. The application could build one list from all the tag messages and then query all the serialized tags from tag setters. The delta tells what has not been serialized. \nA different approach would be to query the list of supported tags in advance. This could be a query GST_QUERY_TAG_SUPPORT The query result could be a list of elements and their tags. As a convenience we could flatten the list of tags for the top level element if the query was sent to a bin and add that. \n"});
