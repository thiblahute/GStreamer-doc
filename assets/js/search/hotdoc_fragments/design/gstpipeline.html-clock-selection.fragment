fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/gstpipeline.html#clock-selection", "fragment": "Clock selection \nSince all of the children of a GstPipeline must use the same clock the pipeline must select one. This clock selection happens when the pipeline goes to the PLAYING state. \nThe default clock selection algorithm works as follows \nIf the application selected a clock use that clock. see below \nUse the clock of the most upstream element that can provide one. This selection is performed by iterating the element starting from the sinks going upstream. \nUse GstSystemClock this only happens when no element provides a usable clock. \nThe application can influence this clock selection with two methods gst_pipeline_use_clock and gst_pipeline_auto_clock \nThe _use_clock method forces the use of a specific clock on the pipeline regardless of what clock providers are available. Passing a NULL GstClock clock parameter to this method disables all clocking and makes the pipeline run as fast as possible. \nThe _auto_clock method removes the fixed clock and reactivates the auto matic clock selection algorithm described above. \n"});
