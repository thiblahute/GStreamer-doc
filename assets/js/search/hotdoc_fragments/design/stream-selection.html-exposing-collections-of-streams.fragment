It is updated by subsequent messages with a matching identifier. \nIf the element that provided the collection goes away there is no way to know that the streams are no longer valid without having the user app track that element The exception to that is if the bin containing that element such as parsebin or decodebin3 informs that the next collection is a replacement of the former one. \nThe mutual exclusion and relationship lists use stream ids rather than GstStream references in order to avoid circular referencing problems. \n"});
