The structures are in the preferred order of the creator of the caps with the preferred structure being first and during negotiation of caps this order should be considered to select the most optimal structure. \nEach of these structures has a name that specifies the media type e.g. video x theora to specify Theora video. Additional fields in the structure add additional constraints and or information about the media type like the width and height of a video frame or the codec profile that is used. These fields can be non fixed e.g. ranges for non fixed caps but must be fixated to a fixed value during negotiation. If a field is included in the caps returned by a pad via the CAPS query it imposes an additional constraint during negotiation. The caps in the end must have this field with a value that is a subset of the non fixed value. Additional fields that are added in the negotiated caps give additional information about the media but are treated as optional. Information that can change for every buffer and is not relevant during negotiation must not be stored inside the caps. \nFor each of the structures in caps it is possible to store caps features. The caps features are expressing additional requirements for a specific structure and only structures with the same name and equal caps features are considered compatible. Caps features can be used to require a specific memory representation or a specific meta to be set on buffers for example a pad could require for a specific structure that it is passed EGLImage memory or buffers with the video meta. If no caps features are provided for a structure it is assumed that system memory is required unless later negotiation steps e.g. the ALLOCATION query detect that something else can be used. The special ANY caps features can be used to specify that any caps feature would be accepted for example if the buffer memory is not touched at all. \n"});
