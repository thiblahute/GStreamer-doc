We also make this a requirement for going to PLAYING since a flush event in the PAUSED state could unqueue the buffer again. \nThe state is commited in the following conditions \nWe require the state change to be commited in EOS as well since an EOS by definition means no buffer is going to arrive anymore. \nAfter the state is commited a blocking wait should be performed for the next event. Some sinks might render the preroll buffer before starting this blocking wait. \n"});
