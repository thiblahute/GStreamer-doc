Further we want to provide a mechanism for the app to select which program s to decode and once that is known to further tell the app which elementary streams are then available within those program s so the app user can choose which audio track s to decode and or use. \nA new PMT arrives for an MPEG TS stream due to a codec or channel change. The pipeline will need to reconfigure to play the desired streams from new program. Equally there may be multiple seconds of content buffered from the old program and it should still be possible to switch for example subtitle tracks responsively in the draining out data as well as selecting which subs track to play from the new feed. This same scenario applies when doing gapless transition to a new source file URL except that likely the element providing the list of streams also changes as a new demuxer is installed. \nWhen playing a multi angle DVD the DVD Virtual Machine needs to extract angle from the data for presentation. It can publish the available angles as logical streams even though only one stream can be chosen. \nWhen playing a DVD the user can make stream selections from the DVD menu to choose audio or sub picture tracks or the DVD VM can trigger automatic selections. In addition the player UI should be able to show which audio subtitle tracks are available and allow direct selection in a GUI the same as for normal files with subtitle tracks in them. \nPlaying a SCHC DTV feed where one view is MPEG and the other is H.264 and they should be combined for D presentation or not bother decoding stream if displaying D. bug https bugzilla.gnome.org show_bug.cgi id \nFIXME need some use cases indicating what alternate streams in HLS might require what are the possibilities \n"});
