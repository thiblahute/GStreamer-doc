Elements include sources filters sinks and containers Bins They may be an intrinsic part of the core GStreamer library or may be loaded from a plugin. In some cases they re even fabricated from completely different systems see the LADSPA plugin Elements are generally created from a GstElementFactory which will be covered in another chapter but for the intrinsic types they can be created with specific functions. \nElements contain GstPads also covered in another chapter which are subsequently used to connect the Elements together to form a pipeline capable of passing and processing data. They have a parent which must be another Element. This allows deeply nested pipelines and the possibility of black box meta elements. \n"});
