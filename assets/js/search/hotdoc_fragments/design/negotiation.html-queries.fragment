The list of supported caps can be used to choose an appropriate GstCaps for the data transfer. The CAPS query works recursively elements should take their peers into consideration when constructing the possible caps. Because the result caps can be very large a filter can be used to restrict the caps. Only the caps that match the filter will be returned as the result caps. The order of the filter caps gives the order of preference of the caller and should be taken into account for the returned caps. \nA pad can ask the peer pad if it supports a given caps. It does this with the ACCEPT_CAPS query. The caps must be fixed. The ACCEPT_CAPS query is not required to work recursively it can simply return TRUE if a subsequent CAPS event with those caps would return success. \n"});
