fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/gstobject.html#page-description", "fragment": "The base class for the entire GStreamer hierarchy is the GstObject. \nA pointer is available to store the current parent of the object. This is one of the two fundamental requirements for a hierarchical system such as GStreamer for the other read up on GstBin Three functions are provided _set_parent _get_parent and _unparent The third is required because there is an explicit check in _set_parent an object must not already have a parent if you wish to set one. You must unparent the object first. This allows for new additions later. \nThe GstObject contains the necessary primitives to lock the object in a thread safe manner. This will be used to provide general thread safety as needed. However this lock is generic i.e. it covers the whole object. \nThe object LOCK is a very lowlevel lock that should only be held to access the object properties for short periods of code. \nAll members of the GstObject structure marked as public with LOCK are protected by this lock. These members can only be accessed for reading or writing while the lock is held. All members should be copied or reffed if they are used after releasing the LOCK. \nNote that this does not mean that no other thread can modify the object at the same time that the lock is held. It only means that any two sections of code that obey the lock are guaranteed to not be running simultaneously. The lock is voluntary and cooperative \nThis lock will ideally be used for parentage flags and naming which is reasonable since they are the only possible things to protect in the GstObject. \nIn parent child situations the lock of the parent must always be taken first before taking the lock of the child. It is NOT allowed to hold the child lock before taking the parent lock. \nThis policy allows for parents to iterate their children and setting properties on them. \nWhenever a nested lock needs to be taken on objects not involved in a parent child relation eg. pads an explictic locking order has to be defined. \nDue to the base nature of the GstObject it becomes the only reasonable place to put this particular function _get_path_string It will generate a string describing the parent hierarchy of a given GstObject. \nEach object in the GStreamer object hierarchy can have flags associated with it which are used to describe its state or a features. \n"});
