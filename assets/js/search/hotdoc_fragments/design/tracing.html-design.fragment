fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/tracing.html#design", "fragment": "Design \nThe system brings the following new items core hooks probes in the core api that will expose internal state when tracing is in use tracers plugin features that can process data from the hooks and emit a log tracing front ends applications that consume logs from tracers \nLike the logging the tracer hooks can be compiled out and if not use a local condition to check if active. \nCertain GStreamer core function such as gst_pad_push or gst_element_add_pad will call into the tracer subsystem to dispatch into active tracing modules. Developers will be able to select a list of plugins by setting an environment variable such as GST_TRACERS meminfo dbus One can also pass parameters to plugins GST_TRACERS log events buffers stats all When then plugins are loaded we ll add them to certain hooks according to which they are interested in. \nRight now tracing info is logged as GstStructures to the TRACE level. Idea Another env var GST_TRACE_CHANNEL could be used to send the tracing to a file or a socket. See https bugzilla.gnome.org show_bug.cgi id for discussion on these environment variables. \n"});
