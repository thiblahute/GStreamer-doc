This value is called the absolute_time. A GstClock always counts time upwards and does not necessarily start at \nDifferent sources exist for this counter \nthe system time with g_get_current_time and with microsecond accuracy \nmonotonic time with g_get_monotonic_time with microsecond accuracy \nan audio device based on number of samples played \na network source based on packets received timestamps in those packets a typical example is an RTP source \n\nIn GStreamer any element can provide a GstClock object that can be used in the pipeline. The GstPipeline object will select a clock from all the providers and will distribute it to all other elements see gstpipeline \nWhile it is possible it is not recommended to create a clock derived from the contents of a stream for example create a clock from the PCR in an mpeg ts stream \n"});
