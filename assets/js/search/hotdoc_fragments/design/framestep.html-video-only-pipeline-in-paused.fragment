This can be done with a positive or negative rate depending on the required frame stepping direction. \napp steps frames in GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT or GST_FORMAT_BUFFER The pipeline loses its PAUSED state until the required number of frames have been skipped it then prerolls again. This skipping is purely done in the sink. \nsink posts STEP_DONE with amount of frames stepped and corresponding time interval. \n"});
