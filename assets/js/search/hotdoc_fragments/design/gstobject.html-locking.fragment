fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/gstobject.html#locking", "fragment": "Locking \nThe GstObject contains the necessary primitives to lock the object in a thread safe manner. This will be used to provide general thread safety as needed. However this lock is generic i.e. it covers the whole object. \nThe object LOCK is a very lowlevel lock that should only be held to access the object properties for short periods of code. \nAll members of the GstObject structure marked as public with LOCK are protected by this lock. These members can only be accessed for reading or writing while the lock is held. All members should be copied or reffed if they are used after releasing the LOCK. \nNote that this does not mean that no other thread can modify the object at the same time that the lock is held. It only means that any two sections of code that obey the lock are guaranteed to not be running simultaneously. The lock is voluntary and cooperative \nThis lock will ideally be used for parentage flags and naming which is reasonable since they are the only possible things to protect in the GstObject. \n"});
