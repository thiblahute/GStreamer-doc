It is also possible that more data should be buffered while the pipeline is PLAYING in which case the pipeline should be PAUSED until the buffering finishes. \nBUFFERING messages can be posted while the pipeline is prerolling. The application should not set the pipeline to PLAYING before a BUFFERING message with a percent value is received which might only happen after the pipeline prerolls. \nAn exception is made for live pipelines. The application may not change the state of a live pipeline when a buffering message is received. Usually these buffering messages contain the buffering mode live \nThe buffering message can also instruct the application to switch to a periodical BUFFERING query instead so it can more precisely control the buffering process. The application can for example choose not to act on the BUFFERING complete message buffer percent to resume playback but use the estimated download time instead resuming playback when it has determined that it should be able to provide uninterrupted playback. \n"});
