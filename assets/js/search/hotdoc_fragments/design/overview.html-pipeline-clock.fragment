Clock values are expressed in nanoseconds. Elements use the clock time to synchronize the playback of data. \nBefore the pipeline is set to PLAYING the pipeline asks each element if they can provide a clock. The clock is selected in the following order \nIf the application selected a clock use that one. \nIf a source element provides a clock use that clock. \nSelect a clock from any other element that provides a clock start with the sinks. \nIf no element provides a clock a default system clock is used for the pipeline. \nIn a typical playback pipeline this algorithm will select the clock provided by a sink element such as an audio sink. \nIn capture pipelines this will typically select the clock of the data producer which in most cases can not control the rate at which it produces data. \n"});
