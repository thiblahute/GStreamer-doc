fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/overview.html#pipeline-construction", "fragment": "Pipeline construction \nThe application starts by creating a Pipeline element using gst_pipeline_new Elements are added to and removed from the pipeline with gst_bin_add and gst_bin_remove \nAfter adding the elements the pads of an element can be retrieved with gst_element_get_pad Pads can then be linked together with gst_pad_link \nSome elements create new pads when actual dataflow is happening in the pipeline. With g_signal_connect one can receive a notification when an element has created a pad. These new pads can then be linked to other unlinked pads. \nSome elements cannot be linked together because they operate on different incompatible data types. The possible datatypes a pad can provide or consume can be retrieved with gst_pad_get_caps \nBelow is a simple mp3 playback pipeline that we constructed. We will use this pipeline in further examples. \n"});
