fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/events.html#latency", "fragment": "LATENCY \nA latency event is used to configure a certain latency in the pipeline. It contains a single GstClockTime with the required latency. The latency value is calculated by the pipeline and distributed to all sink elements before they are set to PLAYING. The sinks will add the configured latency value to the timestamps of the buffer in order to delay their presentation. See also latency \n"});
