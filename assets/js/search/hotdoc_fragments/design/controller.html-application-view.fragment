For that they need to create a GstControlSource and attach it to a property using GstControlBinding. Various control sources and control bindings exist. All control sources produce control value sequences in the form of gdouble values. The control bindings map them to the value range and type of the bound property. \nOne control source can be attached to one or more properties at the same time. If it is attached multiple times then each control binding will scale and convert the control values to the target property type and range. \nOne can create complex control curves by using a GstInterpolationControlSource. This allows the classic user editable control curve often seen in audio video editors Another way is to use computed control curves. GstLFOControlSource can generate various repetitive signals. Those can be made more complex by chaining the control sources. One can attach another control source to e.g. modulate the frequency of the first GstLFOControlSource. \nIn most cases GstDirectControlBinding will be the binding to be used. Other control bindings are there to handle special cases such as having control sources and combine their values into a single guint to control a rgba color property. \n"});
