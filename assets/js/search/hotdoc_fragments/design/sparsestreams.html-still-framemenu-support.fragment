Instead they represent a pause in the presentation of a stream. Correctly performing the wait requires some synchronisation with downstream elements. \nIn this scenario an upstream element that wants to execute a still frame performs the following steps \nSend all data before the still frame wait \nSend a DRAIN event to ensure that all data has been played downstream. \nwait on the clock for the required duration possibly interrupting if necessary due to an intervening activity such as a user navigation \nFLUSH the pipeline using a normal flush sequence FLUSH_START chain lock FLUSH_STOP \nSend a SEGMENT to restart playback with the next timestamp in the stream. \nThe upstream element performing the wait must only do so when in the PLAYING state. During PAUSED the clock will not be running and may not even have been distributed to the element yet. \nDRAIN is a new event that will block on a src pad until all data downstream has been played out. \nFlushing after completing the still wait is to ensure that data after the wait is played correctly. Without it sinks will consider the first buffers x seconds where x is the duration of the wait that occurred to be arriving late at the sink and they will be discarded instead of played. \n"});
