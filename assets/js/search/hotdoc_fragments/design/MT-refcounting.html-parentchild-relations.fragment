This method refs and sinks the object and assigns its parent property to that of the managing parent. \nThe child is said to have a weak link to the parent since the refcount of the parent is not increased in this process. This means that if the parent is disposed it has to unset itself as the parent of the object before disposing itself else the child object holds a parent pointer to invalid memory. \nThe responsibilities for an object that sinks other objects are summarised as \ntaking ownership of the object \non dispose \nalso see relations \n"});
