fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/interlaced-video.html#plain-interlaced", "fragment": "Plain Interlaced \nIf the video info interlace mode is interleaved then the buffer is plain interlaced. \nGST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_TFF indicates whether the top or bottom field is to be displayed first. The timestamp on the buffer corresponds to the first field. \nGST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_RFF indicates that the first field indicated by the TFF flag should be repeated. This is generally only used for telecine purposes but as the telecine state was added long after the interlaced state was added and defined this flag remains valid for plain interlaced buffers. \nGST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_ONEFIELD means that only the field indicated through the TFF flag is to be used. The other field should be ignored. \n"});
