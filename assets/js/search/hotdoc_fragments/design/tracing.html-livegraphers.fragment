This way e.g. gst validate could consume the traces directly. \nwhen hooking into a timer should we just have some predefined intervals \ncan we add a tracer module that registers the timer hook then we could do GST_TRACER timer ms rusage right now the tracer hooks are defined as an enum though. \nwhen connecting to a running app we can t easily get the current state if logging is using a socket as past events are not explicitly stored we could determine the current topology and emit events with GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE as ts to indicate that the events are synthetic. \nwe need stable ids for scopes threads elements pads \nthe address can be reused \nwe can use gst_util_seqnum_next \nsomething like gst_object_get_path_string won t work as objects are initially without parent \nright now the tracing hooks are enabled disabled from configure with enable disable gst tracer hooks The tracer code and the plugins are still built though. We should add a enable disable gst tracer to disabled the whole system allthough this is a bit confusing with the enable disable trace option we have already. \n"});
