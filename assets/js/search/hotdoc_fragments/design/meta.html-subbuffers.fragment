fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/meta.html#subbuffers", "fragment": "Subbuffers \nSubbuffers are implemented with a generic copy. Parameters to the copy are the offset and size. This allows each metadata structure to implement the actions needed to update the metadata of the subbuffer. \nIt might not make sense for some metadata to work with subbuffers. For example when we take a subbuffer of a buffer with a video frame the GstMetaVideo simply becomes invalid and is removed from the new subbuffer. \n"});
