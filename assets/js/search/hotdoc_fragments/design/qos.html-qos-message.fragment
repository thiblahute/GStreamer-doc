fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/qos.html#qos-message", "fragment": "QoS message \nA QOS message is posted on the bus whenever an element decides to \ndrop a buffer because of QoS reasons \nchange its processing strategy because of QoS reasons quality \nIt should be expected that creating and posting the QoS message is reasonably fast and does not significantly contribute to the QoS problems. Options to disable this feature could also be presented on elements. \nThis message can be posted by a sink src that performs synchronisation against the clock live or it could be posted by an upstream element that performs QoS because of QOS events received from a downstream element live \nThe GST_MESSAGE_QOS contains at least the following info \nlive G_TYPE_BOOLEAN If the QoS message was dropped by a live element such as a sink or a live source. If the live property is FALSE the QoS message was generated as a response to a QoS event in a non live element. \nrunning time G_TYPE_UINT64 The running_time of the buffer that generated the QoS message. \nstream time G_TYPE_UINT64 The stream_time of the buffer that generated the QoS message. \ntimestamp G_TYPE_UINT64 The timestamp of the buffer that generated the QoS message. \nduration G_TYPE_UINT64 The duration of the buffer that generated the QoS message. \njitter G_TYPE_INT64 The difference of the running time against the deadline. Negative values mean the timestamp was on time. Positive values indicate the timestamp was late and dropped by that amount. The deadline can be a realtime running_time or an estimated running_time. \nproportion G_TYPE_DOUBLE Long term prediction of the ideal rate relative to normal rate to get optimal quality. \nquality G_TYPE_INT An element dependent integer value that specifies the current quality level of the element. The default maximum quality is \nformat GST_TYPE_FORMAT Units of the processed and dropped fields. Video sinks and video filters will use GST_FORMAT_BUFFERS frames Audio sinks and audio filters will likely use GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT samples \nprocessed G_TYPE_UINT64 Total number of units correctly processed since the last state change to READY or a flushing operation. \ndropped G_TYPE_UINT64 Total number of units dropped since the last state change to READY or a flushing operation. \nThe running time and processed fields can be used to estimate the average processing rate framerate for video \nElements might add additional fields in the message which are documented in the relevant elements or baseclasses. \n"});
