This the stream time of S.start \nS.applied_rate The rate already applied to the segment. \nStream time is calculated using the buffer times and the preceding SEGMENT event as follows \nFor negative rates B.timestamp will go backwards from S.stop to S.start making the stream time go backwards \nIn the PLAYING state it is also possible to use the pipeline clock to derive the current stream_time. \nGive the two formulas above to match the clock times with buffer timestamps allows us to rewrite the above formula for stream_time and for positive rates \nThis last formula is typically used in sinks to report the current position in an accurate and efficient way. \nNote that the stream time is never used for synchronisation against the clock. \n"});
