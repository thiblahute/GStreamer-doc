This is the case when their intersection is not empty. \nFor checking if a pad actually supports a fixed caps an intersection is not enough. Instead the fixed caps must be at least a subset of the pad s caps but pads can introduce additional constraints which would be checked in the ACCEPT_CAPS query handler. \nData flow can only happen after pads have decided on common fixed caps. These caps are distributed to both pads with the CAPS event. \n"});
