fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/element-source.html#source-types", "fragment": "Source types \nA source element can operate in three ways \nit is fully seekable this means that random access can be performed on it in an efficient way. a file reader This also typically means that the source is not live. \ndata can be obtained from it with a variable size. This means that the source can give N bytes of data. An example is an audio source. A video source always provides the same amount of data one video frame Note that this is not a fully seekable source. \nit is a live source see above. \nWhen writing a source one has to look at how the source can operate to decide on the scheduling methods to implement on the source. \nfully seekable sources implement a getrange function on the source pad. \nsources that can give N bytes but cannot do seeking also implement a getrange function but state that they cannot do random access. \nsources that are purely live sources implement a task to push out data. \nAny source that has a getrange function must also implement a push based scheduling mode. In this mode the source starts a task that gets N bytes and pushes them out. Whenever possible the peer element will select the getrange based scheduling method of the source though. \nA source with a getrange function must activate itself in the pad activate function. This is needed because the downstream peer element will decide and activate the source element in its state change function before the source s state change function is called. \n"});
