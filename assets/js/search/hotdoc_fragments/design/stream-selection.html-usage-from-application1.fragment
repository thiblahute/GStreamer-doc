fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/stream-selection.html#usage-from-application1", "fragment": "Usage from application \nThere are two use cases where an application needs to specify in a generic fashion which streams it wants in output \nFrom the point of view of the application those two use cases are treated identically. The streams are all available through the GstStreamCollection posted on the bus and it will select a subset. \nThe application can select the streams it wants by creating a GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS event with the list of stream id of the streams it wants. That event is then sent on the pipeline eventually traveling all the way upstream from each sink. \nIn some cases selecting one stream may trigger the availability of other dependent streams resulting in new GstStreamCollection messages. This can happen in the case where choosing a different DVB channel would create a new single program collection. \n"});
