When a GstMiniObject is first created it has a refcount of \nEach variable holding a reference to a GstMiniObject is responsible for updating the refcount. This includes incrementing the refcount with gst_mini_object_ref when a reference is kept to a miniobject or gst_mini_object_unref when a reference is released. \nWhen the refcount reaches and thus no objects hold a reference to the miniobject anymore we can free the miniobject. \nWhen freeing the miniobject first the GstMiniObjectDisposeFunction is called. This function is allowed to revive the object again by incrementing the refcount in which case it should return FALSE from the dispose function. The dispose function is used by GstBuffer to revive the buffer back into the GstBufferPool when needed. \nWhen the dispose function returns TRUE the GstMiniObjectFreeFunction will be called and the miniobject will be freed. \n"});
