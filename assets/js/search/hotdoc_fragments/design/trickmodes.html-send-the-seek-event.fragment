By default an element will forward the event upstream on all sinkpads. Elements can modify the format of the seek event. The most common format is GST_FORMAT_TIME. \nOne element will actually perform the seek this is usually the demuxer or source element. For more information on how to perform the different seek types see seeking. \nFor client side trickmode a SEGMENT event will be sent downstream with the new rate and start stop positions. All elements prepare themselves to handle the rate see below The applied rate of the SEGMENT event will be set to to indicate that no rate adjustment has been done. \nfor server side trick mode a SEGMENT event is sent downstream with a rate of and the start stop positions. The elements will configure themselves for normal playback speed since the server will perform the rate conversions. The applied rate will be set to the rate that will be applied by the server. This is done to insure that the position reporting performed in the sink is aware of the trick mode. \nWhen the seek succeeds the _send_event function will return TRUE. \n"});
