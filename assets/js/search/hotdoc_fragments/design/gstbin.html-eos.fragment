This message is only posted to the bus when the sink element is in PLAYING. \nThe bin collects all EOS messages and forwards it to the application as soon as all the sinks have posted an EOS. \nThe list of queued EOS messages is cleared when the bin goes to PAUSED again. This means that all elements should repost the EOS message when going to PLAYING again. \n"});
