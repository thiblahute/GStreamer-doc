The timestamp on the buffer corresponds to the first field. \nGST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_RFF indicates that the first field indicated by the TFF flag should be repeated. This is generally only used for telecine purposes but as the telecine state was added long after the interlaced state was added and defined this flag remains valid for plain interlaced buffers. \nGST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_ONEFIELD means that only the field indicated through the TFF flag is to be used. The other field should be ignored. \nIf video info interlace mode is mixed then the buffers are in some form of telecine state. \nThe TFF and ONEFIELD flags have the same semantics as for the plain interlaced state. \nGST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_RFF in the telecine state indicates that the buffer contains only repeated fields that are present in other buffers and are as such unneeded. For example in a sequence of three telecined frames we might have \nIn this situation we only need the first and third buffers as the second buffer contains fields present in the first and third. \nNote that the following state can have its second buffer identified using the ONEFIELD flag and TFF not set \nThe telecine state requires one additional flag to be able to identify progressive buffers. \nThe presence of the GST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_INTERLACED means that the buffer is an interlaced or mixed buffer that contains two fields that when combined with fields from adjacent buffers allow reconstruction of progressive frames. The absence of the flag implies the buffer containing two fields is a progressive frame. \nFor example in the following sequence the third buffer would be mixed yes it is a strange pattern but it can happen \n"});
