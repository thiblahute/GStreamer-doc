It can reopen a server connection requesting a new byte or time position and a new playback speed. The capabilities can be queried from the server when the connection is opened. \nWe assume the source element is derived from the GstPushSrc base class. The base source should be configured with \nThe do_seek method will be called on the GstPushSrc subclass with the seek information passed in the GstSegment argument. \nThe rate value in the segment should be used to reopen the connection to the server requesting data at the new speed and possibly a new playback position. \nWhen the server connection was successfully reopened set the rate of the segment to so that the client side trickmode is not enabled. The applied rate in the segment is set to the rate transformation done by the server. \nAlternatively a combination of client side and serverside trickmode can be used for example if the server does not support certain rates the client can perform rate conversion for the remainder. \nAfter performing the seek the source will inform the downstream elements of the new segment that is to be played back. Since the segment will have a rate of no client side trick modes are enabled. The segment will have an applied rate different from to indicate that the media contains data with non standard playback speed or direction. \n"});
