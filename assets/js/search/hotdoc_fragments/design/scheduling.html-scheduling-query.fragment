fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/scheduling.html#scheduling-query", "fragment": "Scheduling Query \nA sinkpad can ask the upstream srcpad for its scheduling attributes. It does this with the SCHEDULING query. \nout modes G_TYPE_ARRAY default NULL an array of GST_TYPE_PAD_MODE enums. Contains all the supported scheduling modes. \nout flags GST_TYPE_SCHEDULING_FLAGS default \n_SEEKABLE the offset of a pull operation can be specified if this flag is false the offset should be \n_SEQUENTIAL suggest sequential access to the data. If _SEEKABLE is specified seeks are allowed but should be avoided. This is common for network streams. \n_BANDWIDTH_LIMITED suggest the element supports buffering data for downstream to cope with bandwidth limitations. If this flag is on the downstream element might ask for more data than necessary for normal playback. This use case is interesting for on disk buffering scenarios for instance. Seek operations might be slow as well so downstream elements should take this into consideration. \nout minsize G_TYPE_INT default the suggested minimum size of pull requests \nout maxsize G_TYPE_INT default unlimited the suggested maximum size of pull requests \nout align G_TYPE_INT default the suggested alignment for the pull requests. \n"});
