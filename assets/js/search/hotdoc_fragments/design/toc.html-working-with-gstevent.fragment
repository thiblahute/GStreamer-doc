The idea is the following when you receive TOC select event parse it with gst_event_parse_toc_select and seek stream if it is not streamable for specified TOC UID you can use gst_toc_find_entry to find entry in TOC by UID To create TOC select event use gst_event_new_toc_select The common action on such event is to seek to specified UID within your element. \n"});
