fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/gstbin.html#gstbus", "fragment": "GstBus \nThe GstBin creates a GstBus for its children and distributes it when child elements are added to the bin. The bin attaches a sync handler to receive messages from children. The bus for receiving messages from children is distinct from the bin s own externally visible GstBus. \nMessages received from children are forwarded intact onto the bin s external message bus except for EOS and SEGMENT_START DONE which are handled specially. \nASYNC_START ASYNC_STOP messages received from the children are used to trigger a recalculation of the current state of the bin as described in states. \nThe application can retrieve the external GstBus and integrate it in the mainloop or it can just pop messages off in its own thread. \nWhen a bin goes to READY it will clear all cached messages. \n"});
