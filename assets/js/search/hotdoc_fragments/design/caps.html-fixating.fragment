A structure is fixed if none of its fields is of an unfixed type for example a range list or array. \nFor fixating caps only the first structure is kept as the order in which they appear is meant to express their precedence. Afterwards each unfixed field of this structure is set to the value that makes most sense for the media format by the element or pad implementation and then every remaining unfixed field is set to an arbitrary value that is a subset of the unfixed field s values. \nEMPTY caps are fixed caps and ANY caps are not. Caps with ANY caps features are not fixed. \n"});
