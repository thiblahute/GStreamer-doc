This is tricky when dealing where situations where we keep some streams and only switch some others. Do we flush all streams Do we only flush the new streams potentially resulting in delay to fully switch Furthermore due to efficient buffering in decodebin3 the switching time has been minimized extensively to the point where flushing might not bring a noticeable improvement. \nStore the stream collection in bins pipelines A Bin Pipeline could store all active collection internally so that it could be queried later on. This could be useful to then get on any pipeline at any point in time the full list of collections available without having to listen to all COLLECTION messages on the bus. This would require fixing the is a collection a replacement or not issue first. \nWhen switching to new collections should decodebin3 make any effort to map corresponding streams from the old to new PMT that is try and stick to the english language audio track for example Alternatively rely on the app to do such smarts with stream select messages \n"});
