The application can choose to download the file to disk. The buffer element will provide a push or pull based srcpad to the demuxer to navigate in the downloaded file. \nThis mode is only suitable when the client can determine the length of the file on the server. \nIn this case buffering messages will be emitted as usual when the requested range is not within the downloaded area buffersize. The buffering message will also contain an indication that incremental download is being performed. This flag can be used to let the application control the buffering in a more intelligent way using the BUFFERING query for example. \nThe application can use the BUFFERING query to get the estimated download time and match this time to the current remaining playback time to control when playback should start to have a non interrupted playback experience. \n"});
