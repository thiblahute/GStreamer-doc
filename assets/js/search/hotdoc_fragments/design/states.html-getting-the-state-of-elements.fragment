The function returns a GstElementStateReturn. \nIf the element returned SUCCESS to the previous _set_state function this function will return the last state set on the element and VOID_PENDING in the pending state value. The function returns GST_STATE_SUCCESS. \nIf the element returned NO_PREROLL to the previous _set_state function this function will return the last state set on the element and VOID_PENDING in the pending state value. The function returns GST_STATE_NO_PREROLL. \nIf the element returned FAILURE to the previous _set_state call this function will return FAILURE with the state set to the current state of the element and the pending state set to the value used in the last call of _set_state \nIf the element returned ASYNC to the previous _set_state call this function will wait for the element to complete its state change up to the amount of time specified in the GstClockTime. \nIf the element does not complete the state change in the specified amount of time this function will return ASYNC with the state set to the current state and the pending state set to the pending state. \nIf the element completes the state change within the specified timeout this function returns the updated state and VOID_PENDING as the pending state. \nIf the element aborts the ASYNC state change due to an error within the specified timeout this function returns FAILURE with the state set to last successful state and pending set to the last attempt. The element should also post an error message on the bus with more information about the problem. \n"});
