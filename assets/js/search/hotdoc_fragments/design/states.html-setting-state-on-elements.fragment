The plugin should have posted an error message on the bus with information. \nGST_STATE_SUCCESS The state change is completed successfully. \nGST_STATE_ASYNC The state change will complete later on. This can happen when the element needs a long time to perform the state change or for sinks that need to receive the first buffer before they can complete the state change preroll \nGST_STATE_NO_PREROLL The state change is completed successfully but the element will not be able to produce data in the PAUSED state. \nIn the case of an ASYNC state change it is possible to proceed to the next state before the current state change completes however the element will only get to this next state before completing the previous ASYNC state change. After receiving an ASYNC return value you can use element_get_state to poll the status of the element. If the polling returns SUCCESS the element completed the state change to the last requested state with set_state \nWhen setting the state of an element the STATE_PENDING is set to the required state. Then the state change function of the element is called and the result of that function is used to update the STATE and STATE_RETURN fields STATE_NEXT STATE_PENDING and STATE_RETURN fields. If the function returned ASYNC this result is immediately returned to the caller. \n"});
