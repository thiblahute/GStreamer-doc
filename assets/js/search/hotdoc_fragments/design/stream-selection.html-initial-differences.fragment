If parsers are needed present they are placed before the multiqueue. This is needed in order for multiqueue to work only with packetized and properly timestamped streams. \nNote that the whole typefinding of streams and optional depayloading demuxing and parsing are done in a new parsebin element. \nJust like the current implementation demuxers will expose all streams present within a program as source pads. They will connect to parsers and multiqueue. \nInitial setup. video stream audio streams. \n"});
