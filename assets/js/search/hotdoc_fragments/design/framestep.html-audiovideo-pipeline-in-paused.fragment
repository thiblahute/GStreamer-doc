This can be done with a positive or negative rate depending on the required frame stepping direction. \napp steps frames in GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT or GST_FORMAT_BUFFER or an amount of time on the video sink. The pipeline loses its PAUSED state until the required number of frames have been skipped it then prerolls again. This skipping is purely done in the sink. \nsink posts STEP_DONE with amount of frames stepped and corresponding time interval. \nthe app skips the same amount of time on the audiosink to align the streams again. When huge amount of video frames are skipped there needs to be enough queueing in the pipeline to compensate for the accumulated audio. \n"});
