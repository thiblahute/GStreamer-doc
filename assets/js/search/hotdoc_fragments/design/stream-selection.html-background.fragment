fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/stream-selection.html#background", "fragment": "Background \nThis new API is intended to address the use cases described in this section \nAs a user app I want an overview and control of the media streams that can be configured within a pipeline for processing even when some streams are mutually exclusive or logical constructs only. \nThe user app can disable entirely streams it s not interested in so they don t occupy memory or processing power discarded as early as possible in the pipeline. The user app can also re enable them at a later time. \nIf the set of possible stream configurations is changing the user app should be aware of the pending change and be able to make configuration choices for the new set of streams as well as possibly still reconfiguring the old set \nElements that have some other internal mechanism for triggering stream selections DVD or maybe some scripted playback playlist should be able to trigger selection of some particular stream. \nIndicate known relationships between streams for example that separate video feeds represent the views of a stereoscopic view or that certain streams are mutually exclusive. \nNote the streams that are available are not automatically the ones active or present in the pipeline as pads. Think HLS DASH alternate streams. \n"});
