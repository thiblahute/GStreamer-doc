fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/live-source.html#live-sources", "fragment": "Live sources \nA live source is a source that cannot be arbitrarily PAUSED without losing data. \nA live source such as an element capturing audio or video needs to be handled in a special way. It does not make sense to start the dataflow in the PAUSED state for those devices as the user might wait a long time between going from PAUSED to PLAYING making the previously captured buffers irrelevant. \nA live source therefore only produces buffers in the PLAYING state. This has implications for sinks waiting for a buffer to complete the preroll state since such a buffer might never arrive. \nLive sources return NO_PREROLL when going to the PAUSED state to inform the bin pipeline that this element will not be able to produce data in the PAUSED state. NO_PREROLL should be returned for both READY PAUSED and PLAYING PAUSED. \nWhen performing a get_state on a bin with a non zero timeout value the bin must be sure that there are no live sources in the pipeline because otherwise the get_state function would block on the sinks. \nA gstbin therefore always performs a zero timeout get_state on its elements to discover the NO_PREROLL and ERROR elements before performing a blocking wait. \n"});
