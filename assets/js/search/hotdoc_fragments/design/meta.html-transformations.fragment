fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/meta.html#transformations", "fragment": "Transformations \nAfter certain transformations the metadata on a buffer might not be relevant anymore. \nConsider for example metadata that lists certain regions of interest on the video data. If the video is scaled or rotated the coordinates might not make sense anymore. A transform element should be able to adjust or remove the associated metadata when it becomes invalid. \nWe can make the transform element aware of the metadata so that it can adjust or remove in an intelligent way. Since we allow arbitrary metadata we can t do this for all metadata and thus we need some other way. \nOne proposition is to tag the metadata type with keywords that specify what it functionally refers too. We could for example tag the metadata for the regions of interest with a tag that notes that the metadata refers to absolute pixel positions. A transform could then know that the metadata is not valid anymore when the position of the pixels changed due to rotation flipping scaling and so on \n"});
