After that buffers are sent one after the other. After the last buffer an EOS marks the end of the stream. No more buffers are to be processed after the EOS event. \nSTREAM_START \nSEGMENT rate start stop time \nN buffers \ndisplayable buffers are between start stop of the SEGMENT S Buffers outside the segment range should be dropped or clipped. \nrunning_time \na monotonically increasing value that can be used to synchronize against the clock See also synchronisation \nstream_time \nThese events are generated typically either by the GstBaseSrc class for sources operating in push mode or by a parser demuxer operating in pull mode and pushing parsed demuxed data downstream. \n"});
