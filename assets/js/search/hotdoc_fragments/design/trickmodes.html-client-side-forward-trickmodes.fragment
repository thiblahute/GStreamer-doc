If S is the speedup factor a good algorithm for implementing frame skipping is to send audio in chunks of Nms usually ms is good and then skip S Nns of audio data. For the video we send only the keyframes in the S Nns interval. In this case the demuxer would scale the timestamps and would set an applied rate of S. \n"});
