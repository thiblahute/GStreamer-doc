fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/progress.html#async-state-changes", "fragment": "Async state changes \nGStreamer currently has a GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC return value to note to the application that a state change is happening asynchronously. \nThe main purpose of this return value is to make the pipeline wait for preroll and delay a future upwards state changes until the sinks are prerolled. \nIn the case of async operations on source this will automatically force sinks to stay async because they will not preroll before the source can produce data. \nThe fact that other asynchronous operations happen behind the scenes is irrelevant for the prerolling process so it is not implemented with the ASYNC state change return value in order to not complicate the state changes and mix concepts. \n"});
