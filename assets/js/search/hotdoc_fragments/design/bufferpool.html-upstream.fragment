This instructs upstream to renegotiate both the format and the bufferpool when needed. \nA pipeline reconfiguration happens when new elements are added or removed from the pipeline or when the topology of the pipeline changes. Pipeline reconfiguration also triggers possible renegotiation of the bufferpool and caps. \nA RECONFIGURE event tags each pad it travels on as needing reconfiguration. The next buffer allocation will then require the renegotiation or reconfiguration of a pool. \n"});
