Indeed given arrival time T1 as given in we can be certain that buffers with a timestamp B2 T1 will be too late in the sink. \nIn case of a positive jitter we can therefore send a QoS event with a timestamp B1 jitter J1 and proportion given by \nThis allows an upstream element to not generate any data with timestamps B2 T1 where the element can derive T1 as B1 J1. \nThis will effectively result in frame drops. \nThe element can even do a better estimation of the next valid timestamp it should output. \nIndeed given the element generated a buffer with timestamp B0 that arrived in time in the sink but then received a QoS event stating B1 arrived J1 too late. This means generating B1 took B1 J1 B0 T1 T0 PT1 as given in Given the buffer B1 had a duration D1 and assuming that generating a new buffer B2 will take the same amount of processing time a better estimation for B2 would then be \nexpanding gives \nassuming the durations of the frames are equal and thus D1 D2 \nalso \nso \nWhich yields a more accurate prediction for the next buffer given as \n"});
