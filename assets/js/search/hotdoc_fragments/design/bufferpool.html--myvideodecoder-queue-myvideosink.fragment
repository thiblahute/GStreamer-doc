fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/bufferpool.html#-myvideodecoder-queue-myvideosink", "fragment": "myvideodecoder queue myvideosink \nmyvideodecoder has negotiated a bufferpool with the downstream myvideosink to handle buffers of size x240. It has now detected a change in the video format and needs to renegotiate to a resolution of x480. This requires it to negotiate a new bufferpool with a larger buffer size. \nWhen myvideodecoder needs to get the bigger buffer it starts the negotiation of a new bufferpool. It queries a bufferpool from downstream reconfigures it with the new configuration which includes the bigger buffer size and sets the bufferpool to active. The old pool is inactivated and unreffed which causes the old format to drain. \nIt then uses the new bufferpool for allocating new buffers of the new dimension. \nIf at some point the decoder wants to switch to a lower resolution again it can choose to use the current pool which has buffers that are larger than the required size or it can choose to renegotiate a new bufferpool. \n"});
