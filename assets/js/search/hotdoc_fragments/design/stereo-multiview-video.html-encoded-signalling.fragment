For all MVC methods I know the multiview encoding is in the video bitstream itself and therefore already available to decoders. Only stereo systems have been retro fitted into the demuxer. \nAlso sometimes extension descriptions are in the codec e.g. H.264 SEI FPA packets and it would be useful to be able to put the info onto caps and buffers from the parser without decoding. \nTo handle both cases we need to be able to output the required details on encoded video for decoders to apply onto the raw video buffers they decode. \nIf there ever is a need to transport multiview info for encoded data the same system below for raw video or some variation should work \n"});
