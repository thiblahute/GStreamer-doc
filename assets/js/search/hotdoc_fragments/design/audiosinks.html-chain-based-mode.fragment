This operation will eventually block when the ringbuffer is filled. \nWhen no samples arrive in time the ringbuffer will play silence. Each buffer that arrives will be placed into the ringbuffer at the correct times. This means that dropping samples or inserting silence is done automatically and very accurate and independend of the play pointer. \nIn this mode the ringbuffer is usually kept as full as possible. When using a small buffer small segsize and segtotal the latency for audio to start from the sink to when it is played can be kept low but at least one context switch has to be made between read and write. \n"});
