fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/seeking.html#gst_seek_flag_accurate", "fragment": "GST_SEEK_FLAG_ACCURATE \nIf the ACCURATE flag is specified in a seek request the demuxer parser is asked to do whatever it takes to make sure the position seeked to is accurate in relation to the beginning of the stream. This means that it is not acceptable to just approximate the position e.g. using an average bitrate The achieved position must be exact. In the worst case the demuxer or parser needs to push data from the beginning of the file and let downstream clip everything before the requested segment start. \nThe ACCURATE flag does not affect what the segment start should be in relation to the requested seek position. Only the KEY_UNIT flag or its absence has any effect on that. \nVideo editors and frame stepping applications usually use the ACCURATE flag. \n"});
