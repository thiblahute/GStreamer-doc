It can work with a fixed size buffer in memory or on disk. \nThe size of the buffer is usually expressed in a fixed amount of time units and the estimated bitrate of the upstream source is used to convert this time to bytes. \nAll GStreamer applications must implement this strategy. Failure to do so will result in starvation at the sink. \n"});
