fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/draft-tagreading.html#tagreading", "fragment": "Tagreading \nThe tagreading metadata reading use case for mediacenter applications is not too well supported by the current GStreamer architecture. It uses demuxers on the files which generally said takes too long building seek index prerolling What we want is specialized elements parsing modes that just do the tag reading. \nThe idea is to define a TagReadIFace. Tag demuxers classic demuxers and decoder plugins can just implement the interface or provide a separate element that implements the interface. \nIn addition we need a tagreadbin that similar to decodebin does a typefind and then plugs the right tagread element s If will only look at elements that implement the interface. It can plug serval if possible. \nFor optimal performance typefind and tagread could share the list of already peeked buffers a queue element after sink but that would change pull to push \n"});
