This happens because the sink element blocks on the first buffer it receives. \nSome elements might be performing blocking operations in the PLAYING state that must be unblocked when they go into the PAUSED state. This makes sure that the state change happens very fast. \nIn the next PAUSED to READY state change the pipeline has to shut down and all streaming threads must stop sending data. This happens in the following sequence \nThe upstream elements finish their _chain function because the downstream element returned an error code FLUSHING from the _push functions. These error codes are eventually returned to the element that started the streaming thread filesrc which pauses the thread and completes the state change. \nThis sequence of events ensure that all elements are unblocked and all streaming threads stopped. \n"});
