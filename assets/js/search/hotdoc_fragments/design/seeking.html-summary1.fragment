In this case the expectation is that the demuxer parser does a resonable best effort attempt trading speed for accuracy. In the absence of an index the seek position may be approximated. \nif the ACCURATE flag is specified absolute accuracy is required and speed is of no concern. It is not acceptable to just approximate the seek position in that case. \nthe ACCURATE flag does not imply that the segment starts at the requested seek position or should be adjusted to the nearest keyframe only the KEY_UNIT flag determines that. \n"});
