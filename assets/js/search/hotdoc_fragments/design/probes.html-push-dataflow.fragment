fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/probes.html#push-dataflow", "fragment": "Push dataflow \nPush probes have the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PUSH flag set in the callbacks. \nIn push based scheduling the blocking probe is called first with the data item. Then the data probes are called before the peer pad chain or event function is called. \nThe data probes are called before the peer pad is checked. This allows for linking the pad in either the BLOCK or DATA probes on the pad. \nBefore the peerpad chain or event function is called the peer pad block and data probes are called. \nFinally the IDLE probe is called on the pad after the data was sent to the peer pad. \nThe push dataflow probe behavior is the same for buffers and bidirectional events. \n"});
