It is typically done when reading from a slow non live network source but can also be used for live sources. \nWe want to be able to implement the following features \nbuffering up to a specific amount of data in memory before starting playback so that network fluctuations are minimized. \ndownload of the network file to a local disk with fast seeking in the downloaded data. This is similar to the quicktime youtube players. \ncaching of semi live streams to a local on disk ringbuffer with seeking in the cached area. This is similar to tivo like timeshifting. \nprogress report about the buffering operations \nthe possibility for the application to do more complex buffering \n"});
