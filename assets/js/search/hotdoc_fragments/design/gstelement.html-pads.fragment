They provide the connection capability with allowing arbitrary structure in the graph. For any Element but a source or sink there will be at least Pads owned by the Element. These pads are stored in a single GList within the Element. Several counters are kept in order to allow quicker determination of the type and properties of a given Element. \nPads may be added to an element with _add_pad Retrieval is done via _get_static_pad which operates on the name of the Pad the unique key This means that all Pads owned by a given Element must have unique names. A pointer to the GList of pads may be obtained with _iterate_pads \ngst_element_add_pad element pads Sets the element as the parent of the pad then adds the pad to the element s list of pads keeping the counts of total src and sink pads up to date. Emits the new_pad signal with the pad as argument. Fails if either the element or pad are NULL or not what they claim to be. Should fail if the pad already has a parent. Should fail if the pad is already owned by the element. Should fail if there s already a pad by that name in the list of pads. \npad gst_element_get_pad element padname Searches through the list of pads \n"});
