A pad that behaves this way exposes a loop function that will be repeatedly called until it returns false. This loop function is allowed to block whenever it wants. When the pad is deactivated the loop function should unblock though. \nA pad operating in the push mode can only produce data to a pad that exposes a chain function. This chain function will be called with the buffer produced by the pushing pad. \nThis method of producing data is called the streaming mode since the producer produces a constant stream of data. \n"});
