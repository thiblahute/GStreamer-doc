fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/probes.html#pull-dataflow", "fragment": "Pull dataflow \nPull probes have the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PULL flag set in the callbacks. \nThe gst_pad_pull_range call will first trigger the BLOCK probes without a DATA item. This allows the pad to be linked before the peer pad is resolved. It also allows the callback to set a data item in the probe info. \nAfter the blocking probe and the getrange function is called on the peer pad and there is a data item the DATA probes are called. \nWhen control returns to the sinkpad the IDLE callbacks are called. The IDLE callback is called without a data item so that it will also be called when there was an error. \nIf there is a valid DATA item the DATA probes are called for the item. \n"});
