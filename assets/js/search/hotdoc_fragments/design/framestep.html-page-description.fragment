This can be done with a positive or negative rate depending on the required frame stepping direction. \napp configures frames steps in GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT or GST_FORMAT_BUFFER or an amount of time on the sink. The step event has a flag indicating live stepping so that the stepping will only happens in PLAYING. \napp sets pipeline to PLAYING. The pipeline continues PLAYING until it consumed the amount of time. \nsink posts STEP_DONE with amount of frames stepped and corresponding time interval. The sink will then wait for another step event. Since the STEP_DONE message was emitted by the sink when it handed off the buffer to the device there is usually sufficient time to queue a new STEP event so that one can seamlessly continue stepping. \n"});
