The GstProxyPad pairs have opposite directions the GstGhostPad has the same direction as the future ghosted pad target \nThe GstGhostPad X is also set as the parent of the GstProxyPad Y \nThe target is a pointer to the internal pads peer. It is an optimisation to quickly get to the peer of a ghostpad without having to dereference the internal peer. \nSome use case follow with a description of how the datastructure is modified. \n"});
