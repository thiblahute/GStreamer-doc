This element can receive a Window ID from the application through the VideoOverlay interface and will then render video frames in this drawable. If no Window ID was provided by the application the element will create its own internal window and render into it. \nSee the GstGLDisplay documentation for a list of environment variables that can override window platform detection. \n"});
