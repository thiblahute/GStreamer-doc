Specifically it modifies the comments header packet of the kate stream as well as the language and category of the kate stream. \nThe element will also process the stream as the GstKateParse element does so it can be used when remuxing an Ogg Kate stream without additional elements. \nApplications can set the tags to write using the GstTagSetter interface. Tags contained within the kate stream will be picked up automatically and merged according to the merge mode set via the tag setter interface \n"});
