This is used in the\nmultifdsink case where you want to stream live kate streams to multiple\nclients, each client has to receive the streamheaders first before they can\nconsume the kate packets.</p>\n<p>This element also makes sure that the buffers that it pushes out are properly\ntimestamped and that their offset and offset_end are set. The buffers that\nkateparse outputs have all of the metadata that oggmux expects to receive,\nwhich allows you to (for example) remux an ogg/kate file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-pipelines\">Example pipelines</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-[\"> gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=kate.ogg ! oggdemux ! kateparse ! fakesink\n</code></pre>\n<p>This pipeline shows that the streamheader is set in the caps, and that each\nbuffer has the timestamp, duration, offset, and offset_end set.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-[\"> gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=kate.ogg ! oggdemux ! kateparse \\\n            ! oggmux ! filesink location=kate-remuxed.ogg\n</code></pre>\n<p>This pipeline shows remuxing. kate-remuxed.ogg might not be exactly the same\nas kate.ogg, but they should produce exactly the same decoded data.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n"});
