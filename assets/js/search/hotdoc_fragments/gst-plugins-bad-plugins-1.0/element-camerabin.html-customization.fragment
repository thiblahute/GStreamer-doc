Default is jpeg for images and ogg theora and vorbis for video. If a profile without an audio stream is set for video audio will be disabled on recordings. \npreview caps can be used to select which format preview images should be posted on the GstBus. It has to be a raw video format. \nCamerabin has a camera source property so applications can set their source that will provide buffers for the viewfinder and for captures. This camera source is a special type of source that has pads. To use a regular source with a single pad you should use GstWrapperCameraBinSource it will adapt your source and provide pads. \nApplications can also select the desired viewfinder sink using viewfinder sink it is also possible to select the audio source using audio source. \nThe viewfinder resolution can be configured using viewfinder caps these GstCaps should be a subset of viewfinder supported caps. \nTo select the desired resolution for captures camerabin provides image capture caps and video capture caps these caps must be a subset of what the source can produce. The allowed caps can be probed using image capture supported caps and video capture supported caps. In an analogous way there are audio capture caps and audio capture supported caps. \nCamerabin also allows applications to insert custom GstElement on any of its branches video capture image capture viewfinder and preview.
