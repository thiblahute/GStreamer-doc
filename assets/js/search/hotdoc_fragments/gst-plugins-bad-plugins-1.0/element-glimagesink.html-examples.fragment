No special opengl extension is used in this pipeline that s why it should work with OpenGL That s the case if you are using the MESA3D driver v1.3. \nA pipeline to test hardware scaling and hardware colorspace conversion. When your driver supports GLSL OpenGL Shading Language needs OpenGL the following format YUY2 UYVY I420 YV12 and AYUV are converted to RGB32 through some fragment shaders and using one framebuffer FBO extension OpenGL If your driver does not support GLSL but supports MESA_YCbCr extension then the you can use YUY2 and UYVY. In this case the colorspace conversion is automatically made when loading the texture and therefore no framebuffer is used. \nA pipeline OpenGL.
