Video or image capture mode can be selected using the mode property and the file to save the capture is selected using location property. \nAfter creating camerabin applications might want to do some customization there s a section about this below then select the desired mode and start capturing. \nIn image capture mode just send a GstCameraBin start capture and a picture will be captured. When the picture is stored on the selected location a GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT named image done will be posted on the GstBus. \nIn video capture mode send a GstCameraBin start capture to start recording then send a GstCameraBin stop capture to stop recording. Note that both signals are asynchronous so calling GstCameraBin stop capture doesn t guarantee that the video has been properly finished yet. Applications should wait for the video done message to be posted on the bus. \nIn both modes if post previews is TRUE a GstBuffer will be post to the GstBus in a field named buffer in a preview image message of type GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT. \n"});
