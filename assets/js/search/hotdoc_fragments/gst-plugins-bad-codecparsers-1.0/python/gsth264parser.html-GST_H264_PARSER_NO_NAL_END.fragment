This will be returned if no start sync marker for the next NAL unit was found. In this case the parser will assume that the end of the data is also the end of the NAL unit. Whether this assumption is correct or not depends on the context which only the caller can know which is why a special result value is returned in this case. If the data is NAL aligned then GstCodecParsers.H264ParserResult can be treated just like GstCodecParsers.H264ParserResult. If the data is not guaranteed to be NAL aligned then the caller probably wants to collect more data until there s another sync marker or the end of the stream has been reached. \n"});
