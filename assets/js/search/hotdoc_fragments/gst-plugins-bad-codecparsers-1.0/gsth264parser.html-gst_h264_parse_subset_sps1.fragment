The resulting sps structure shall be deallocated with gst_h264_sps_clear when it is no longer needed. \nNote if the caller doesn t need any of the MVC specific data then gst_h264_parser_parse_sps is more efficient because those extra syntax elements are not parsed and no extra memory is allocated. \n"});
