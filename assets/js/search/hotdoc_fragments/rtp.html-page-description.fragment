It can also distribute a GStreamer net client clock to GStreamer RTSP clients to facilitate multi device synchronization. \nThe GStreamer rtspsrc element from gst plugins good is GStreamer s high level RTSP client abstraction. It can be used as a standalone element directly or can be used via playbin by passing an rtsp URI to playbin. rtspsrc features a number of GObject properties that allow you to configure it in all kinds of different ways most notably a latency property to configure the default jitterbuffer latency which you may want to configure to a lower value to achieve lower latency. \nMost of GStreamer s key RTP components live in gst plugins good \nwith some lower level libraries in gst plugins base \nSome of the main components are \nNote that many RTP elements assume they receive RTP buffers with GstNetAddressMeta meta data set on them as udpsrc will produce \n"});
