Bugzilla will show you a list of existing bugs that look similar when you file your bug so please have a look at the list to see if anything looks like it matches. The GStreamer bugs page also has shortcuts for the major components and simple search functionality if you d like to browse or search for existing bugs. \nIf you are filing a feature request i.e. anything that is not supposed to work already that is anything not a bug please set your bug s severity to enhancement. This won t affect the way we prioritise the issue but it does make triaging easier for us. \nIf your bug is about a specific plugin or element or utility library please prefix the bug summary with element name plugin name or lib and keep the rest of the description as short and precise as possible. \nExamples \nThis makes sure developers looking through the list of open bugs or bug notification mails can quickly identify what your bug is about. If your text is too long and only contains fill words at the beginning the important information will be cut off and not show up in the list view or mail client. \nIf you don t know in which component the problem is just select don t know and we ll move it to the right component once we have a better idea what the problem is. \nPlease mention \nTry to describe how the bug can be reproduced. If it is triggered by any specific file try to make the file available somewhere for download and put the link into the bug report. The easier it is for us to reproduce the issue the easier it is to fix it. \nIf you experience a crash that is the application shuts down unexpectedly usually with a segfault or bus error or memory access violation or such please try to obtain a stack trace. If there are criticals or warnings printed right before the crash run with the environment variable G_DEBUG fatal_warnings set then it will abort on the first warning which should hopefully give an indication to where the problem is. You can then obtain a stack trace from where it aborts. \nIf the application errors out please provide a gst debug log. You can get one by setting the GST_DEBUG environment variable combined with GST_DEBUG_FILE tmp dbg.log. This is going to be very large so it s advisable to compress it with xz tmp dbg.log before sharing it. You may be asked to provide one for specific debug categories rather than everything \nIf possible at all you should prepare patches against a current git checkout ideally against the tip of the master branch but in many cases patches against a stable release will be acceptable as well if the plugin or code hasn t changed much since then. If a patch was prepared against an old branch and does not apply any longer to master you may be asked to provide an updated patch. \nIf you have created a new plugin please submit a patch that adds it to the gst plugins bad module including configure.ac and the various Makefile.am modifications and all new files. \n"});
