Bugzilla will show you a list of existing bugs that look similar when you file your bug so please have a look at the list to see if anything looks like it matches. The GStreamer bugs page also has shortcuts for the major components and simple search functionality if you d like to browse or search for existing bugs. \nOnce you have created a bug you can attach your patch es to the bug report see below for more details. You can add one attachment when you file the bug but if you have multiple things to attach you will have to do that after the bug has been submitted. \nIf your patch is for an enhancement anything that is not supposed to work already i.e. anything not a bug or adds new API please set your bug s severity to enhancement. This won t affect the way we prioritise your bug but it does make triaging easier for us. \nIf your patch is against a specific plugin or element or utility library please prefix the bug summary with element name plugin name or lib and keep the rest of the description as short and precise as possible. \nExamples \nThis makes sure developers looking through the list of open bugs or bug notification mails can quickly identify what your bug is about. If your text is too long and only contains fill words at the beginning the important information will be cut off and not show up in the list view or mail client. \nPlease create separate bugs for separate issues. There is no golden rule when something counts as a separate issue please just use your best judgment. For example if you have a change that needs to be done in each module one bug for all the patches for the various modules is fine. If there is an issue that requires related fixes in multiple elements or libraries please also feel free to put everything into one bug report. If you just happen to have multiple patches for us but they are not really related please put them in separate bugs. The main question is if it makes sense to discuss and review these patches together or if they could just as well be handled completely separately. \nPlease do not send patches to the gstreamer devel mailing list. Patches submitted on the mailing list are most likely going to be ignored overlooked or you will get a brief reply asking you to put them into bugzilla. We do not use the mailing list for bug review. \nPlease do not send pull requests to our github mirror. They will be closed automatically. \nPlease also do not attach patches to already existing bugs unless they really are directly relevant to the issue i.e. do not attach patches to already existing bugs that are only vaguely related to your issue. \n"});
