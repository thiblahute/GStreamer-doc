This means that there is usually no need to advertise the fact that you have done so in other forums such as on IRC or on the mailing list unless you have been asked to file a bug there in which case it s nice to follow up with the link to the bug. \nMost of all please be patient. \nWe try to review patches as quickly as possible but there is such a high turnaround of bugs patches and feature requests that it is not always possible to tend to them all as quickly as we d like. This is especially true for completely new plugins or new features. \nIf you haven t received any response at all for a while say two weeks or so do feel free to ping developers by posting a quick follow up comment on the bug. \nIf you do not get a response this is usually not a sign of people ignoring the issue but usually just means that it s fallen through the cracks or people have been busy with other things. \n"});
