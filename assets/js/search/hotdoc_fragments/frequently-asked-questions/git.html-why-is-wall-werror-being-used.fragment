Not all of them are necessarily a problem but it s better to have the compiler report some false positives and find a work around than to spend time chasing a bug for days that the compiler was giving you hints about. \nWerror is turned off for actual releases. It s turned on by default for git and prereleases so that people actually notice and fix problems found by Wall We want people to actively hit and report or fix them. \nIf for any reason you want to bypass these flags and you are certain it s the right thing to do you can run \nto clear the CFLAGS for error checking. \n"});
