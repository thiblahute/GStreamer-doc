What s wrong \nWhy is Wall Werror being used \nYes You have two options you can either run GStreamer in an uninstalled setup see How do I develop against an uninstalled GStreamer copy or you can use GNOME s jhbuild. \nGStreamer is hosted on Freedesktop.org. GStreamer consists of various parts. In the beginning you will be interested in the gstreamer module containing the core and gst plugins base and gst plugins good containing the basic set of plugins. Finally you may also be interested in gst plugins ugly gst plugins bad and gst ffmpeg for more comprehensive media format support. \nTo check out the latest git version of the core and the basic modules use \nThis will create three directories in your current directory gstreamer gst plugins base and gst plugins good If you want to get another module use the above git clone command line and replace module with the name of the module. Once you have checked out these modules you will need to change into each directory and run autogen.sh which will among other things checkout the common module underneath each module checkout. \nThe modules page has a list of active ones together with a short description. \nIf you want to gain developer access to GStreamer git you should ask for it on the development lists or ask one of the maintainers directly. We will usually only consider requests by developers who have been active and competent GStreamer contributors for some time already. If you are not already a registered developer with a user account on Freedesktop.org you will then have to provide them with \nyour desired unix username \nyour full name \nyour e mail address \na copy of your public sshv2 identity. If you do not have this yet you can generate it by running ssh keygen t rsa f ssh id_rsa.pub fdo The resulting public key will be in ssh id_rsa.pub fdo \nyour GPG fingerprint. This would allow you to add and remove ssh keys to your account. \nOnce you have all these items see http freedesktop.org wiki AccountRequests for what to do with them. \nWhat s wrong \naclocal is unable to find two macros installed by libtool in a file called libtool.m4. Normally this would indicate that you don t have libtool but that would mean autogen.sh would have failed on not finding libtool. \nIt is more likely that you installed automake which provides aclocal in a different prefix than libtool. You can check this by examining in what prefix both aclocal and libtool are installed. \nYou can do three things to fix this \ninstall automake in the same prefix as libtool \nforce use of the automake installed in the same prefix as libtool by using the with automake option \nfigure out what prefix libtool has been installed to and point aclocal to the right location by running \nwhere you replace prefix with the prefix where libtool was installed. \nWall is being used because it finds a lot of possible problems with code. Not all of them are necessarily a problem but it s better to have the compiler report some false positives and find a work around than to spend time chasing a bug for days that the compiler was giving you hints about. \nWerror is turned off for actual releases. It s turned on by default for git and prereleases so that people actually notice and fix problems found by Wall We want people to actively hit and report or fix them. \nIf for any reason you want to bypass these flags and you are certain it s the right thing to do you can run \nto clear the CFLAGS for error checking. \n"});
