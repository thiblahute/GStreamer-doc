You have two options: you can either run GStreamer in an\nuninstalled setup (see <a href=\"../#developing-uninstalled-gstreamer\">How do I develop against an uninstalled\nGStreamer copy ?</a>), or you can use\nGNOME's jhbuild.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-check-out-gstreamer-from-git-\">How do I check out GStreamer from git ?</h2>\n<p>GStreamer is hosted on Freedesktop.org. GStreamer consists of\nvarious parts. In the beginning, you will be interested in the\n\"gstreamer\" module, containing the core, and \"gst-plugins-base\" and\n\"gst-plugins-good\", containing the basic set of plugins. Finally, you\nmay also be interested in \"gst-plugins-ugly\", \"gst-plugins-bad\" and\n\"gst-ffmpeg\" for more comprehensive media format support.</p>\n<p>To check out the latest git version of the core and the basic modules,\nuse</p>\n<pre><code> for module in gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good; do\n   git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/gstreamer/$module ;\n done\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will create three directories in your current directory:\n\"gstreamer\", \"gst-plugins-base\", and \"gst-plugins-good\". If you want to\nget another module, use the above git clone command line and replace\n$module with the name of the module. Once you have checked out these\nmodules, you will need to change into each directory and run\n./autogen.sh, which will among other things checkout the common module\nunderneath each module checkout.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/\">modules page</a> has a list\nof active ones together with a short description.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-developer-access-to-gstreamer-git-\">How do I get developer access to GStreamer git ?</h2>\n<p>If you want to gain developer access to GStreamer git, you should\nask for it on the development lists, or ask one of the maintainers\ndirectly. We will usually only consider requests by developers who have\nbeen active and competent GStreamer contributors for some time already.\nIf you are not already a registered developer with a user account on\nFreedesktop.org, you will then have to provide them with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>your desired unix username</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your full name</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your e-mail address</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a copy of your public sshv2 identity. If you do not have this yet,\nyou can generate it by running \"ssh-keygen -t rsa -f\n~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub-fdo\". The resulting public key will be in\n<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub-fdo</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your GPG fingerprint. This would allow you to add and remove ssh\nkeys to your account.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have all these items, see\n<a href=\"http://freedesktop.org/wiki/AccountRequests\">http://freedesktop.org/wiki/AccountRequests</a> for what to do with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-ran-autogensh-but-it-fails-with-aclocal-errors-whats-wrong-\">I ran autogen.sh, but it fails with aclocal errors. What's wrong ?</h2>\n<pre><code>+ running aclocal -I m4 -I common/m4 ...\naclocal: configure.ac: 8: macro `AM_DISABLE_STATIC' not found in library\naclocal: configure.ac: 17: macro `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL' not found in library\naclocal failed\n</code></pre>\n<p>What's wrong ?</p>\n<p>aclocal is unable to find two macros installed by libtool in a\nfile called libtool.m4. Normally this would indicate that you don't have\nlibtool, but that would mean autogen.sh would have failed on not finding\nlibtool.</p>\n<p>It is more likely that you installed automake (which provides aclocal)\nin a different prefix than libtool. You can check this by examining in\nwhat prefix both aclocal and libtool are installed.</p>\n<p>You can do three things to fix this :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>install automake in the same prefix as libtool</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>force use of the automake installed in the same prefix as libtool by\nusing the --with-automake option</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>figure out what prefix libtool has been installed to and point\naclocal to the right location by running</p>\n<pre><code>export ACLOCAL_FLAGS=\"-I $(prefix)/share/aclocal\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>where you replace prefix with the prefix where libtool was\ninstalled.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-wall-werror-being-used-\">Why is \"-Wall -Werror\" being used ?</h2>\n<p>\"-Wall\" is being used because it finds a lot of possible problems\nwith code. Not all of them are necessarily a problem, but it's better to\nhave the compiler report some false positives and find a work-around\nthan to spend time chasing a bug for days that the compiler was giving\nyou hints about.</p>\n<p>\"-Werror\" is turned off for actual releases. It's turned on by default\nfor git and prereleases so that people actually notice and fix problems\nfound by \"-Wall\". We want people to actively hit and report or fix them.</p>\n<p>If for any reason you want to bypass these flags and you are certain\nit's the right thing to do, you can run</p>\n<pre><code>make ERROR_CFLAGS=\"\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>to clear the CFLAGS for error checking.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
