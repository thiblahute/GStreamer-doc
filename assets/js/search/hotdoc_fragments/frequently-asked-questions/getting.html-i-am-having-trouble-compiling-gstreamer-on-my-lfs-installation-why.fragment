Being volunteered based we can t promise support to anyone of course but are you using LFS consider yourself extra unsupported. We neither can or want to know enough about how your unique system is configured to be able to help you. That said if you come to the gstreamer channel on irc.openprojects.net we might of course be able to give you some general hints and pointers. \n"});
