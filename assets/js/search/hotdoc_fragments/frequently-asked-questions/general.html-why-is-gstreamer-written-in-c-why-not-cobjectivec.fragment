Aside from personal preference there are a number of technical reasons why C is nice in this project \nC is extremely portable. \nC is fast. \nIt is easy to make language bindings for libraries written in C. \nThe GObject object system provided by GLib implements objects in C in a portable and powerful way. This library provides for introspection and runtime dynamic typing. It is a full OO system but without the syntactic sugar. If you want sugar take a look at Vala. \nUse of C integrates nicely with Gtk and GNOME. Some people like this a lot but neither Gtk nor GNOME are required by GStreamer. \nThere are also historical reasons When GStreamer was started C and free and open source C compilers were not as stable and mature as they are today and there was the desire to provide a certain degree of API and ABI stability. \nIn closing we like C. If you don t that s fine if you still want to help out on GStreamer we always need more language binding people. If not don t bother us we re working \n"});
