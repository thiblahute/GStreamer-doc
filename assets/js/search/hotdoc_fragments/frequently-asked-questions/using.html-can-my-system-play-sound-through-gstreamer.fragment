For this you need to link the audiotestsrc element to an output element that matches your hardware. A non complete list of output plug ins for audio is \npulsesink for Pulseaudio output \nalsasink for ALSA output \nosssink and oss4sink for OSS OSSv4 output \njackaudiosink for JACK output \nautoaudiosink for automatic audio output selection \nFirst of all run gst inspect on the output plug in you want to use to make sure you have it installed. For example if you use Pulseaudio run \nand see if that prints out a bunch of properties for the plug in. \nThen try to play the sine tone by running \nand see if you hear something. Make sure your volume is turned up but also make sure it is not too loud and you are not wearing your headphones. \n"});
