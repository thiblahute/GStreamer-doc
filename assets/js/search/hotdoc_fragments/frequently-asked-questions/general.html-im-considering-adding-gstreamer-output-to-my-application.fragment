GStreamer is not a sound server so you don t output directly to GStreamer and it s not an intermediate API between audio data and different kinds of audio sinks. It is a fundamental design decision to use GStreamer in your application there are no easy ways of somehow transfering data from your app to GStreamer well there are of course but they would be reserved for special use cases Instead your application would have to use or implement a number of GStreamer elements string them together and tell them to run. In that manner the data would all be internal to the GStreamer pipeline. \nThat said it is possible to write a plugin specific to your app that can get at the audio or video data. \n"});
