If you are a developer interested in adding MIDI support to GStreamer please get in touch we would definitely be interested in that. \nAs for what exists today the alsamidisrc element can be used to fetch ALSA MIDI sequencer events and makes them available to elements that understand the audio x midi events format. \nMIDI playback is provided by plugins such as midiparse fluiddec wildmidi and timidity. \n"});
