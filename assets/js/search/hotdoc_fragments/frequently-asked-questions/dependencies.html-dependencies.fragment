fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "frequently-asked-questions/dependencies.html#dependencies", "fragment": "Dependencies \nWhy are there so many dependencies \nMaking a full featured media framework is a huge undertaking in itself. By using the work done by others we both reduce the amount of redundant work being done and leave ourselves free to work on the architecture itself instead of working on the low level stuff. We would be stupid not to reuse the code others have written. \nHowever do realize that in no way you are forced to have all dependencies installed. None of the core developers has all of them installed. GStreamer has only a few obligate dependencies GLib liborc and very common stuff like glibc a C compiler and so on. All of the other dependencies are optional. \nSo in closing let s rephrase the question to Why are you giving me so many choices and such a rich environment \nIs GStreamer X11 independent Can it be used headless \nYes we have no hard dependency on X11 or any other windowing system in any of our modules. There are many GStreamer applications that run fine without any need for display servers or windowing systems for example streaming servers transcoding applications or audio applications that don t output any video. Other applications output video to a framebuffer custom made hardware sinks or via wayland. \nWhat is GStreamer s position on efforts such as LADSPA or LV2 \nGStreamer actively supports such efforts and in the case of LADSPA or LV2 we already have wrapper plugins. These wrapper plug ins detect the LADSPA LV2 plugins present on your system at run time and make them available as GStreamer elements. \nDoes GStreamer support MIDI \nThere is some rudimentary MIDI support in GStreamer but it s not complete yet. \nThe GStreamer architecture should be able to support the needs of MIDI applications very well a full implementation is still missing however. If you are a developer interested in adding MIDI support to GStreamer please get in touch we would definitely be interested in that. \nAs for what exists today the alsamidisrc element can be used to fetch ALSA MIDI sequencer events and makes them available to elements that understand the audio x midi events format. \nMIDI playback is provided by plugins such as midiparse fluiddec wildmidi and timidity. \nDoes GStreamer depend on GNOME or GTK \nNo it s just that many of the applications developed for GStreamer happen to be GNOME or GTK applications including some of our sample applications. There are just as many applications that use the Qt toolkit or that are written for Mac OS X Windows Android or iOS. We aim to provide an API that is toolkit agnostic so that GStreamer can be used from any toolkit desktop environment or operating system. \n"});
