Some of the libraries we use for some of the plugins are however under the GPL which means that those plugins can not be used by a non GPL compatible application. Those are few and far between though and there are usually non GPL alternatives available for those GPL libraries. \nAs part of the GStreamer source download you find a file called LICENSE_readme in gst plugins package. That file contains information in the exact licensing terms of the libraries we use. As a general rule GStreamer aims at using only LGPL or BSD licensed libraries if available and only use GPL or proprietary libraries where no good LGPL or BSD alternatives are available. \nYou can see the effective license of a plugin as license field in gst inspect In the future we might have the application enforce a stricter policy much like tainting in the kernel \n"});
