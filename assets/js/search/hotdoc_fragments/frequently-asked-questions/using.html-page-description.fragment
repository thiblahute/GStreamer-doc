If this tells you that there is no such element or plugin you haven t installed GStreamer correctly. Please check how to get GStreamer If this fails with any other message we would appreciate a bug report. \nIt s time to try out a few things. Start with gst launch and two plug ins that you really should have fakesrc and fakesink. They do nothing except pass empty buffers. Type this at the command line \nThis will print out output that looks similar to this \nSome parts of output have been removed for clarity If it looks similar then GStreamer itself is running correctly. \nTo get a test video displayed try \nIf autovideosink doesn t work try an element that s specific for your operating system and windowing system such as ximagesink or glimagesink or on windows d3dvideosink. \nYou can test this by trying to play a sine tone. For this you need to link the audiotestsrc element to an output element that matches your hardware. A non complete list of output plug ins for audio is \npulsesink for Pulseaudio output \nalsasink for ALSA output \nosssink and oss4sink for OSS OSSv4 output \njackaudiosink for JACK output \nautoaudiosink for automatic audio output selection \nFirst of all run gst inspect on the output plug in you want to use to make sure you have it installed. For example if you use Pulseaudio run \nand see if that prints out a bunch of properties for the plug in. \nThen try to play the sine tone by running \nand see if you hear something. Make sure your volume is turned up but also make sure it is not too loud and you are not wearing your headphones. \nTo do this you use the gst inspect command line tool which comes standard with GStreamer. Invoked without any arguments \nwill print out a listing of installed plugins. To learn more about a particular plugin pass its name on the command line. For example \nwill give you information about the volume plugin. \nBugs are tracked in GNOME s Bugzilla at http bugzilla.gnome.org under the product GStreamer. Using bugzilla you can view past bug history report new bugs submit patches etc. Bugzilla requires you to create an account there which might seem cumbersome but allows us to at least have a chance at contacting you for further information as we will often have to do. \nWhen doing a bug report you should at least describe \nyour distribution distribution version and GStreamer version \nhow you installed GStreamer from git source packages which \nif you installed GStreamer before \nIf the application you are having problems with is segfaulting then provide us with the necessary gdb output. See \nYou access the GStreamer command line interface using the command gst launch To play a file you could just use \nor \nTo decode an mp3 audio file and play it through Pulseaudio you could also use \nor \nMore examples can be found in the gst launch man page. \nTo automatically detect the right codec in a pipeline try \nor \nSomething more complicated \nWe also have a basic media playing plugin that will take care of most things for you. This plugin is called playbin. Try this \nThis should play the file if the format is supported ie. you have all the necessary demuxing and decoding and some output plugins installed. \n"});
