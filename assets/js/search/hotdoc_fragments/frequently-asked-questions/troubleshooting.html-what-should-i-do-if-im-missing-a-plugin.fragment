What do I do \nWell start by checking if you really are missing the plug in. \nand replace plug in with the plug in you think is missing. If this doesn t return any result then you either don t have it or it can t be found which can easily happen if you have installed things from source \nIf you re not sure either way then chances are good that you don t have it. You should get the plug in and restart the application. How to get the plug in depends on your distribution. Many applications and distributions nowadays support automatic plugin installation of missing plugins. Mayb also try playing your file with a different application if your application does not support installation of missing plugins. \nif you run GStreamer using packages for your distribution you should check what packages are available for your distribution and see if any of the available packages contains the plug in. Make sure you have the common plugin packages installed such as gst plugins base gst plugins good gst plugins ugly gst plugins bad and gst libav. \nif you run GStreamer from a source install there s a good chance the plug in didn t get built because you are missing an external library. When you ran configure you should have gotten output of what plug ins are going to be built. You can re run configure to see if it s there. If it isn t there is a good reason why it is not getting built. The most likely is that you re missing the library you need for it. Check the README file in gst plugins to see what library you need. Make sure to remember to re run configure after installing the supporting library \nif you run GStreamer from git the same logic applies as for a source install. Go over the reasons why the plug in didn t get configured for build. Check output of config.log for a clue as to why it doesn t get built if you re sure you have the library needed installed in a sane place. \n"});
