The following is mostly aimed at Linux unix setups. \nGStreamer uses the pkg config utility to provide applications with the right compiler and linker flags. pkg config is a standard build tool that is widely used unix systems to locate libraries and retrieve build settings so if you re familiar with using it already then you re basically set. \nIf you re not familiar with pkg config to compile and link a small one file program pass the cflags and libs arguments to pkg config. For example \nwould be sufficient for a gstreamer only program. If for example your application also used GTK you could use \nThose are back ticks on the same key with the tilde on US keyboards not single quotes. \nFor bigger projects you should integrate pkg config use in your Makefile or integrate with autoconf using the pkg.m4 macro providing PKG_CONFIG_CHECK \nIt is possible to develop and compile against an uninstalled copy of gstreamer and gst plugins for example against git checkouts This allows you to develop against and test the latest GStreamer version without having to install it and without interfering with your system wide GStreamer setup. \nThere are two ways to achieve such a setup \ngst build is our new meta build module based on the Meson build system. This is the shiny new thing. It s fast and simple to get started with but you will need a recent version of Meson installed. Just check out the git repository and run the setup.py script. Once the initial meson configure stage has passed you can enter an uninstalled environment by running ninja uninstalled in the build directory. This will make sure tools and plugin from the uninstalled build tree will be used. Any problems let us know. \ngst uninstalled is our traditional autotools and libtool based build setup. The easiest way too create such a setup is using the latest version of the create uninstalled setup.sh script. This setup makes use of the latest version of the gst uninstalled script. Running this script you ll be in an environment where the uninstalled tools and plugins will be used by default. Also pkg config will detect the uninstalled copies before and prefer them to any installed copies. \nMultiple uninstalled setups can be used in parallel e.g. one for the latest stable branch and one for git master. Have a look at the gst uninstalled script to see how it determines which environment is used. \nFor GNOME applications it s a good idea to use GConf to find the default ways of outputting audio and video. You can do this by using the gconfaudiosink and gconfvideosink elements for audio and video output. They will take care of everything GConf related for you and automatically use the outputs that the user configured. If you are using gconfaudiosink your application should set the profile property. \nWhen you link a program against uninstalled GStreamer using libtool funny shell scripts are made to modify your shared object search path and then run your program. For instance to debug gst launch try \nIf this does not work you re probably using a broken version of libtool. \nIf you build GStreamer using the Meson build system libtool will not be used and this is not a problem. You can run gdb valgrind or any debugging tools directly on the binaries Meson creates in the build directory. \nOur main arena for coordination and discussion are IRC and bugzilla not mailing lists. Join us in gstreamer on irc.freenode.net. There is also a webchat interface. For larger picture questions or getting more input from more people a mail to the gstreamer devel mailing list is never a bad idea however. \nFor public releases GStreamer uses a standard MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO version scheme. If the release consists of mostly bug fixes or incremental changes the MICRO version is incremented. If the release contains big changes the MINOR version is incremented. A change in the MAJOR version indicates incompatible API or ABI changes which happens very rarely the last one dates back to This is also known as semantic versioning. \nEven MINOR numbers indicate stable releases x x x x x and x are our stable release series. Odd MINOR numbers are used for unstable development releases and prereleases which should only be used temporarily for testing your help in testing these tarballs and packages is very much appreciated \nDuring the development cycle GStreamer also uses a fourth or NANO number. If this number is then it s a git development version. Any tarball or package that has a nano number of is made from git and thus not supported. Additionally if you didn t get this package or tarball from the GStreamer team don t have high hopes on it doing whatever you want it to do. \nThe core and almost all plugin modules are basically coded in K R with space indenting. Just follow what s already there and you ll be fine. \nIndividual plugins in gst plugins or plugins that you want considered for addition to one of the gst plugins modules should be coded in the same style. It s easier if everything is consistent. Consistency is of course the goal. \nSimply run your code only the c files not the header files through \nbefore submitting a patch. This is using GNU indent. There is also a gst indent script in the GStreamer core source tree in the tools directory which wraps this and contains the latest option. The easiest way to get the indenting right is probably to develop against a git checkout. The local git commit hook will ensure correct indentation. We only require code files to be indented header files may be indented manually for better readability however please use spaces for indenting not tabs even in header files \nComments should be in ANSI C comment style and code should generally be compatible with ANSI C89 so please declare all variables at the beginning of the block etc. \nPatches should ideally be made against git master or a recent release and should be created using git format patch format. They should then be attached individually to a bug report or feature request in bugzilla. Please don t send patches to the mailing list they will likely get lost there. \nSee How to submit patches for more details. \nI have translated one of the module po files into a new language. How do I get it included \nGStreamer translations are uniformly managed through the Translation Project. There are some instructions on how to join the Translation Project team and submit new translations at http translationproject.org html translators.html. \nNew translations submitted via the Translation Project are merged periodically into git by the maintainers by running make download po in the various modules when preparing a new release. \nWe won t merge new translations or translation fixes directly everything must go via the Translation Project. \n"});
