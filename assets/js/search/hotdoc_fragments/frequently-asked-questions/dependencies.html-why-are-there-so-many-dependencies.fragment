By using the work done by others we both reduce the amount of redundant work being done and leave ourselves free to work on the architecture itself instead of working on the low level stuff. We would be stupid not to reuse the code others have written. \nHowever do realize that in no way you are forced to have all dependencies installed. None of the core developers has all of them installed. GStreamer has only a few mandatory dependencies GLib liborc and very common stuff like glibc a C compiler and so on. All other dependencies are optional. \nIn closing let s rephrase the question to Why are you giving me so many choices and such a rich environment \n"});
