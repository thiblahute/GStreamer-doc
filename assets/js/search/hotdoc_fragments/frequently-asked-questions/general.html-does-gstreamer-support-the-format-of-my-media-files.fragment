If you have trouble playing back a file please first make sure you have all the required plug ins installed. \nGStreamer aims to support every format imaginable but that doesn t mean the developers have managed to achieve that aim yet. If a GStreamer enabled application doesn t play back your files you can help us solve that problem by filing an enhancement request bug for that format. If you have it please provide \nlinks to other players preferably Open Source and working on Unix \nlinks to explanations of the format. \nways to obtain mediafiles in that format to test. \n"});
