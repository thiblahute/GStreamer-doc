What s wrong \nWhat s wrong \naclocal is unable to find two macros installed by libtool in a file called libtool.m4. Normally this would indicate that you don t have libtool but that would mean autogen.sh would have failed on not finding libtool. \nIt is more likely that you installed automake which provides aclocal in a different prefix than libtool. You can check this by examining in what prefix both aclocal and libtool are installed. \nYou can do three things to fix this \ninstall automake in the same prefix as libtool \nforce use of the automake installed in the same prefix as libtool by using the with automake option \nfigure out what prefix libtool has been installed to and point aclocal to the right location by running \nwhere you replace prefix with the prefix where libtool was installed. \n"});
