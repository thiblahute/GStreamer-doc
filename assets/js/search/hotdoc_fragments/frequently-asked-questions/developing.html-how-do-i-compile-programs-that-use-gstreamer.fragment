The following is mostly aimed at Linux unix setups. \nGStreamer uses the pkg config utility to provide applications with the right compiler and linker flags. pkg config is a standard build tool that is widely used unix systems to locate libraries and retrieve build settings so if you re familiar with using it already then you re basically set. \nIf you re not familiar with pkg config to compile and link a small one file program pass the cflags and libs arguments to pkg config.
