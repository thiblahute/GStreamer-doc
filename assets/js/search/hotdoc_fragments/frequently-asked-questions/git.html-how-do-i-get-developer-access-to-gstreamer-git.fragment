We will usually only consider requests by developers who have been active and competent GStreamer contributors for some time already. If you are not already a registered developer with a user account on Freedesktop.org you will then have to provide them with \nyour desired unix username \nyour full name \nyour e mail address \na copy of your public sshv2 identity. If you do not have this yet you can generate it by running ssh keygen t rsa f ssh id_rsa.pub fdo The resulting public key will be in ssh id_rsa.pub fdo \nyour GPG fingerprint. This would allow you to add and remove ssh keys to your account. \nOnce you have all these items see http freedesktop.org wiki AccountRequests for what to do with them. \n"});
