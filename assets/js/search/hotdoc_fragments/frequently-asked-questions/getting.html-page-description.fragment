What's up with that?</h2>\n<p>GStreamer-0.10 and GStreamer-1.0 are the main version 'series'\ncurrently in use. For all practical purposes you should think of them as\ntwo completely different libraries which just happen to have a similar\nname. They can be installed in parallel and are completely independent.</p>\n<p>GStreamer 1.x has been the main stable series since 2012. GStreamer 0.10 is\nno longer maintained.</p>\n<p>For the 0.10 version you will need the 0.10 plugins and bindings\n(gst-plugins 0.10.x, gst-ffmpeg 0.10.x, gst-python 0.10.x etc.), while\nfor the 1.0 version you will need the 1.0 plugins and bindings (ie.\ngst-plugins-base 1.0.x, gst-plugins-good 1.0.x, gst-plugins-ugly 1.0.x,\ngst-plugins-bad 1.0.x, gst-ffmpeg 1.0.x, gst-python 1.0.x). The micro\nversion for each main version does not have to match exactly, only the\nmajor versions needs to be the same (ie. it may be that the current\ngst-plugins-good version is 1.0.6 and the current GStreamer core version\nis 1.0.13). GStreamer-1.0 will not see or use any of the GStreamer-0.10\nplugins and vice versa.</p>\n<p>All GStreamer command line tools are suffixed with their main version,\ne.g. <code>gst-launch-1.0</code> and <code>gst-inspect-1.0</code>.</p>\n<p>Applications will use either GStreamer-1.0 or GStreamer-0.10, since the\n1.0 and 0.10 API/ABI are not compatible.</p>\n<p>Odd-numbered versions such as 0.9.x, 0.11.x, 1.3.x, 1.5.x, 1.7.x etc. are\nunstable developer releases that should generally not be used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-which-gstreamer-version-should-i-get\">So which GStreamer version should I get?</h2>\n<p>You should download GStreamer 1.x. GStreamer-0.10 is no longer maintained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-install-gstreamer-from-source-\">How can I install GStreamer from source ?</h2>\n<p>We provide tarballs of our releases on our own site, at\n<a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/\">http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/</a></p>\n<p>When compiling from source, make sure you set the <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code>\nenvironment variable correctly to the pkgconfig subdir of your install\nprefix's libdir, to make sure your newly-installed GStreamer versions are\npicked up when building against GStreamer. For example, if you\nconfigured GStreamer with the default prefix (which is <code>/usr/local</code>), then\nyou need to</p>\n<pre><code>export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\n</code></pre>\n<p>before building GStreamer plugin modules. After installing GStreamer from\nsource on Linux, run <code>sudo ldconfig</code> to make sure your new libs will be found.</p>\n<p>Please note that GStreamer is not an easy thing to build from source, since it\nhas so many interconnected pieces from multiple modules, which must all be\ninstalled just right and must all find each other in the right versions.</p>\n<p>If you have GStreamer already installed from packages, it is strongly\nrecommended that you find newer packages instead of installing from source, or\nupgrade to a distro version that ships newer packages. Installing from source\ninto one prefix with distro packages in another prefix can cause problems if\nit's not done right, and it is very difficult for anyone to provide help with\nsuch a setup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"are-there-premade-binaries-available-\">Are there premade binaries available ?</h2>\n<p>Yes, we currently provide <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/\">precompiled packages for Windows, OS/X,\nAndroid and iOS</a>.</p>\n<p>We currently do not provide packages for Linux distributions, but rather\nrely on the distributions for that. GStreamer packages should be\navailable for all major (and minor) distributions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-dont-you-provide-premade-binaries-for-distribution-xy-\">Why don't you provide premade binaries for distribution XY ?</h2>\n<p>GStreamer is run on a volunteer basis. The package that are\nprovided are made by non-paid people who do this on their own time. The\ndistributions we support with binaries are the distributions that we\nhave people who have volunteered to make binaries for. If you are\ninterested in maintaining GStreamer binaries for other distributions or\nUnices we would be happy to hear from you. Contact us through the\nGStreamer-devel mailing list.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-am-having-trouble-compiling-gstreamer-on-my-lfs-installation-why-\">I am having trouble compiling GStreamer on my LFS installation, why ?</h2>\n<p>If you are running LFS our basic opinion is that you should be\nknowledgeable enough to solve any build issues you get on your own.\nBeing volunteered based we can't promise support to anyone of course,\nbut are you using LFS consider yourself extra unsupported. We neither\ncan or want to know enough, about how your unique system is configured,\nto be able to help you. That said, if you come to the #gstreamer\nchannel on irc.openprojects.net we might of course be able to give you\nsome general hints and pointers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-gstreamer-through-git-\">How do I get GStreamer through git ?</h2>\n<p>See this page : <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/dev/\">http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/dev/</a> for git\naccess (anonymous and developer).</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
