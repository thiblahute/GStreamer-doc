For all practical purposes you should think of them as two completely different libraries which just happen to have a similar name. They can be installed in parallel and are completely independent. \nGStreamer x has been the main stable series since GStreamer is no longer maintained. \nFor the version you will need the plugins and bindings gst plugins x gst ffmpeg x gst python x etc. while for the version you will need the plugins and bindings ie. gst plugins base x gst plugins good x gst plugins ugly x gst plugins bad x gst ffmpeg x gst python x The micro version for each main version does not have to match exactly only the major versions needs to be the same ie. it may be that the current gst plugins good version is and the current GStreamer core version is GStreamer will not see or use any of the GStreamer plugins and vice versa. \nAll GStreamer command line tools are suffixed with their main version e.g. gst launch and gst inspect \nApplications will use either GStreamer or GStreamer since the and API ABI are not compatible. \nOdd numbered versions such as x x x x x etc. are unstable developer releases that should generally not be used. \nYou should download GStreamer x. GStreamer is no longer maintained. \nWe provide tarballs of our releases on our own site at http gstreamer.freedesktop.org src \nWhen compiling from source make sure you set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable correctly to the pkgconfig subdir of your install prefix s libdir to make sure your newly installed GStreamer versions are picked up when building against GStreamer. For example if you configured GStreamer with the default prefix which is usr local then you need to \nbefore building GStreamer plugin modules. After installing GStreamer from source on Linux run sudo ldconfig to make sure your new libs will be found. \nPlease note that GStreamer is not an easy thing to build from source since it has so many interconnected pieces from multiple modules which must all be installed just right and must all find each other in the right versions. \nIf you have GStreamer already installed from packages it is strongly recommended that you find newer packages instead of installing from source or upgrade to a distro version that ships newer packages. Installing from source into one prefix with distro packages in another prefix can cause problems if it s not done right and it is very difficult for anyone to provide help with such a setup. \nYes we currently provide precompiled packages for Windows OS X Android and iOS. \nWe currently do not provide packages for Linux distributions but rather rely on the distributions for that. GStreamer packages should be available for all major and minor distributions. \nGStreamer is run on a volunteer basis. The packages that are provided are made by non paid people who do this on their own time. The distributions we support with binaries are the distributions that we have people who have volunteered to make binaries for. If you are interested in maintaining GStreamer binaries for other distributions or Unices we would be happy to hear from you. Contact us through the GStreamer devel mailing list. \nIf you are running LFS our basic opinion is that you should be knowledgeable enough to solve any build issues you get on your own. Being volunteered based we can t promise support to anyone of course but are you using LFS consider yourself extra unsupported. We neither can or want to know enough about how your unique system is configured to be able to help you. That said if you come to the gstreamer channel on irc.openprojects.net we might of course be able to give you some general hints and pointers. \nSee this page http gstreamer.freedesktop.org dev for git access anonymous and developer \n"});
