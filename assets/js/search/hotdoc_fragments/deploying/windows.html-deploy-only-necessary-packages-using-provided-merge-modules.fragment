GStreamer is divided in packages which roughly take care of different tasks. There is the core package the playback package the networking package etc. Each package contains the necessary libraries and files to accomplish its task. \nThe Merge Modules are pieces that can be put together to build a larger Windows Installer. In this case you just need to create a deployment project for your application with Visual Studio and then add the Merge Modules for the GStreamer packages your application needs. \nThis will produce a smaller installer than deploying the complete GStreamer without the added burden of having to manually pick each library. You just need to know which packages your application requires. \nIf you include a merge module in your deployment project remember to include also its dependencies. Otherwise the project will build correctly and install flawlessly but when executing your application it will miss files. \n"});
