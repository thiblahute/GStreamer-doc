For example the prepare method can be overridden to do anything before the software is built or the install and post_install methods for overriding what should be done during or after installation. Take a look at the existing recipes in cerbero recipes for example. \nAlternatively you can pass some options to cerbero uninstalled so some of these attributes are already set for you. For example \nSee cerbero uninstalled add recipe h for help. \nAs an example this is the recipe used to build the Pitivi video editor \nCerbero gets the software sources to build from a GIT repository which is specified via the git_root configuration variable from the Cerbero configuration file see the Build from software section in Installing on Linux and can be overridden by the remotes attribute inside the recipes if setting the origin remote In this case where no commit attribute is specified Cerbero will use the commit named sdk git from the GIT repository when building Snappy. \nOnce the recipe is ready instruct Cerbero to build it \n"});
