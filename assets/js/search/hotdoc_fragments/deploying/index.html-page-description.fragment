You have several options here, and, even though this subject\nis not really in the scope of this documentation, we will give some\nhints to try to help you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiplatform-vs-singleplatform-packaging-system\">Multiplatform vs. single-platform packaging system</h2>\n<p>The first choice you need to make is whether you want to deploy your\napplication to more than one platform. If yes, then you have the choice\nto use a different packaging system for each platform, or use one that\ncan deliver to all platforms simultaneously.
