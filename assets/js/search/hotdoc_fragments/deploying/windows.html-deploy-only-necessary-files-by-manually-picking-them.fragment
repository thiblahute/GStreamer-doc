Unfortunately you are on your own on this road besides using the Dependency Walker tool to discover inter DLL dependencies. \nBear in mind that GStreamer is modular in nature. Plug ins are loaded depending on the media that is being played so if you do not know in advance what files you are going to play you do not know which DLLs you need to deploy. \n"});
