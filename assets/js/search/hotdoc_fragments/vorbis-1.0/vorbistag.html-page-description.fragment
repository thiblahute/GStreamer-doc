Specifically it modifies the comments header packet of the vorbis stream. \nThe element will also process the stream as the GstVorbisParse not introspectable element does so it can be used when remuxing an Ogg Vorbis stream without additional elements. \nApplications can set the tags to write using the GstTagSetter interface. Tags contained withing the vorbis bitstream will be picked up automatically and merged according to the merge mode set via the tag setter interface \nThis element is not useful with gst launch because it does not support setting the tags on a GstTagSetter interface. Conceptually the element will usually be used in this order though. \n"});
