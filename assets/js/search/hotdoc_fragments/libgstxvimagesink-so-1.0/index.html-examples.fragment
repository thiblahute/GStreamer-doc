When the test video signal appears you can resize the window and see that video frames are scaled through hardware no extra CPU cost By default the image will never be distorted when scaled instead black borders will be added if needed. \nSame pipeline with force aspect ratio property set to false. You can observe that no borders are drawn around the scaled image now and it will be distorted to fill the entire frame instead of respecting the aspect ratio. \nA pipeline to test navigation events. While moving the mouse pointer over the test signal you will see a black box following the mouse pointer. If you press the mouse button somewhere on the video and release it somewhere else a green box will appear where you pressed the button and a red one where you released it. The navigationtest element is part of gst plugins good. You can observe here that even if the images are scaled through hardware the pointer coordinates are converted back to the original video frame geometry so that the box can be drawn to the correct position. This also handles borders correctly limiting coordinates to the image area \nThis is faking a pixel aspect ratio caps on video frames produced by videotestsrc in most cases the pixel aspect ratio of the display will be This means that XvImageSink will have to do the scaling to convert incoming frames to a size that will match the display pixel aspect ratio from x240 to x180 in this case \nDemonstrates how to use the colorbalance interface. \n"});
