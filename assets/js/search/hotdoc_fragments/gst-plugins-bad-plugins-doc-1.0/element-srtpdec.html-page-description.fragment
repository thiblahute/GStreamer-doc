It\nreceives packet of type 'application/x-srtp' or 'application/x-srtcp'\non its sink pad, and outs packets of type 'application/x-rtp' or\n'application/x-rtcp' on its source pad.</p>\n<p>For each packet received, it checks if the internal SSRC is in the list\nof streams already in use. If this is not the case, it sends a signal to\nthe user to get the needed parameters to create a new stream : master\nkey, encryption and authentication mecanisms for both RTP and RTCP. If\nthe user can't provide those parameters, the buffer is dropped and a\nwarning is emitted.</p>\n<p>This element uses libsrtp library. The encryption and authentication\nmecanisms available are :</p>\n<p>Encryption</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AES_ICM 256 bits (maximum security)</li>\n<li>AES_ICM 128 bits (default)</li>\n<li>NULL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Authentication</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HMAC_SHA1 80 bits (default, maximum protection)</li>\n<li>HMAC_SHA1 32 bits</li>\n<li>NULL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that for SRTP protection, authentication is mandatory (non-null)\nif encryption is used (non-null).</p>\n<p>Each packet received is first analysed (checked for valid SSRC) then\nits buffer is unprotected with libsrtp, then pushed on the source pad.\nIf protection failed or the stream could not be created, the buffer\nis dropped and a warning is emitted.</p>\n<p>When the maximum usage of the master key is reached, a soft-limit\nsignal is sent to the user, and new parameters (master key) are needed\nin return. If the hard limit is reached, a flag is set and every\nsubsequent packet is dropped, until a new key is set and the stream\nhas been updated.</p>\n<p>If a stream is to be shared between multiple clients the SRTP\nrollover counter for a given SSRC must be set in the caps \"roc\" field\nwhen the request-key signal is emitted by the decoder. The rollover\ncounters should have been transmitted by a signaling protocol by some\nother means. If no rollover counter is provided by the user, 0 is\nused by default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-pipelines\">Example pipelines</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-[\"> gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5004 caps='application/x-srtp, payload=(int)8, ssrc=(uint)1356955624, srtp-key=(buffer)012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789, srtp-cipher=(string)aes-128-icm, srtp-auth=(string)hmac-sha1-80, srtcp-cipher=(string)aes-128-icm, srtcp-auth=(string)hmac-sha1-80' !  srtpdec ! rtppcmadepay ! alawdec ! pulsesink\n ]| Receive PCMA SRTP packets through UDP using caps to specify\n master key and protection.\n |[\n gst-launch-1.0 audiotestsrc ! alawenc ! rtppcmapay !
