This is used in the multifdsink case where you want to stream live kate streams to multiple clients each client has to receive the streamheaders first before they can consume the kate packets. \nThis element also makes sure that the buffers that it pushes out are properly timestamped and that their offset and offset_end are set. The buffers that kateparse outputs have all of the metadata that oggmux expects to receive which allows you to for example remux an ogg kate file. \n"});
