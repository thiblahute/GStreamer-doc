See below for more details on these messages and how to extract the pixbuf object contained in them. \nRetrieving the current pixbuf via the last pixbuf property when needed. This is the easiest way to get at pixbufs for snapshotting purposes just wait until the pipeline is prerolled ASYNC_DONE message on the bus then read the property. If you use this method you may want to disable message posting by setting the post messages property to FALSE. This avoids unnecessary memory overhead. \nThe primary purpose of this element is to abstract away the GstBuffer to GdkPixbuf conversion. Other than that it s very similar to the fakesink element. \nThis element is meant for easy no hassle video snapshotting. It is not suitable for video playback or video display at high framerates. Use ximagesink xvimagesink or some other suitable video sink in connection with the GstXOverlay interface instead if you want to do video playback. \nAs mentioned above this element will by default post element messages containing structures named quot preroll pixbuf quot or quot pixbuf quot on the bus this can be disabled by setting the post messages property to FALSE though The element message structure has the following fields \nProcess one single test image as pixbuf note that the output you see will be slightly misleading. The message structure does contain a valid pixbuf object even if the structure string says NULL \n"});
