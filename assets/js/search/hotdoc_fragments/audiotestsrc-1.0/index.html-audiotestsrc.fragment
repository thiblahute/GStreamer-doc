It support several different waveforms and allows to set the base frequency and volume. \nThis pipeline produces a sine with default frequency Hz and the default volume relative to a maximum \nIn this example a saw wave is generated. The wave is shown using a scope visualizer from libvisual allowing you to visually verify that the saw wave is correct. \n"});
