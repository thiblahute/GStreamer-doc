It can be thought of as a way of treating a GstElement as a black box deterministically feeding it data and controlling what data it outputs. \nThe basic structure of GstHarness is two floating GstPad that connect to the harnessed GstElement src and sink GstPad like so \nWith this you can now simulate any environment the GstElement might find itself in. By specifying the GstCaps of the harness GstPad using functions like gst_harness_set_src_caps or gst_harness_set_sink_caps_str you can test how the GstElement interacts with different caps sets. \nYour harnessed GstElement can of course also be a bin and using gst_harness_new_parse supporting standard gst launch syntax you can easily test a whole pipeline instead of just one element. \nYou can then go on to push GstBuffer and GstEvent on to the srcpad using functions like gst_harness_push and gst_harness_push_event and then pull them out to examine them with gst_harness_pull and gst_harness_pull_event. \n"});
