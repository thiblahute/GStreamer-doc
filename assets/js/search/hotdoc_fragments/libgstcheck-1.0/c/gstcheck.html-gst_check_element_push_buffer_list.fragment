fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstcheck-1.0/c/gstcheck.html#gst_check_element_push_buffer_list", "fragment": "gst_check_element_push_buffer_list \nCreate an element using the factory providing the element_name and push the buffers in buffer_in to this element. The element should create the buffers equal to the buffers in buffer_out. We only check the size and the data of the buffers. This function unrefs the buffers in the two lists. The last_flow_return parameter indicates the expected flow return value from pushing the final buffer in the list. This can be used to set up a test which pushes some buffers and then an invalid buffer when the final buffer is expected to fail for example. \nParameters \nname of the element that needs to be created \na list of buffers that needs to be pushed to the element \nthe GstCaps expected of the sinkpad of the element \na list of buffers that we expect from the element \nthe GstCaps expected of the srcpad of the element \nthe last buffer push needs to give this GstFlowReturn \n"});
