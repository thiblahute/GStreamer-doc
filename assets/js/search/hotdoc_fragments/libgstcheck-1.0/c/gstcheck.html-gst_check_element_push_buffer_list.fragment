The element should create the buffers equal to the buffers in buffer_out. We only check the size and the data of the buffers. This function unrefs the buffers in the two lists. The last_flow_return parameter indicates the expected flow return value from pushing the final buffer in the list. This can be used to set up a test which pushes some buffers and then an invalid buffer when the final buffer is expected to fail for example. \nelement_name \nname of the element that needs to be created \nbuffer_in \na list of buffers that needs to be pushed to the element \ncaps_in \nthe GstCaps expected of the sinkpad of the element \nbuffer_out \na list of buffers that we expect from the element \ncaps_out \nthe GstCaps expected of the srcpad of the element \nlast_flow_return \nthe last buffer push needs to give this GstFlowReturn \n"});
