It will also forward the GST_QUERY_ALLOCATION. \nIf forwarding is disabled the user will have to either manually push these events from the src harness using gst_harness_src_push_event or create and push them manually. While this will allow full control and inspection of these events for the most cases having forwarding enabled will be sufficient when writing a test where the src harness main function is providing data for the main harness. \nForwarding is enabled by default. \nMT safe. \n"});
