By adding a src type GstElement it is then easy to use functions like gst_harness_push_from_src or gst_harness_src_crank_and_push_many to provide your harnessed element with input. The has_clock_wait variable is a greate way to control you src element with in that you can have it produce a buffer for you by simply cranking the clock and not have it spin out of control producing buffers as fast as possible. \nIf a src harness already exists it will be replaced. \nMT safe. \n"});
