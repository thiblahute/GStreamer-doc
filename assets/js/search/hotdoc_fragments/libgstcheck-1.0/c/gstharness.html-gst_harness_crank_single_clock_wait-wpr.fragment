Advance the GstTestClock to the time the GstClockID is waiting for. Release the GstClockID wait. Together this provides an easy way to not have to think about the details around clocks and time but still being able to write deterministic tests that are dependant on this. A crank can be though of as the notion of manually driving the clock forward to its next logical step. \nMT safe. \nParameters \na GstHarness \na gboolean TRUE if the crank was successful FALSE if not. \nSince \n"});
