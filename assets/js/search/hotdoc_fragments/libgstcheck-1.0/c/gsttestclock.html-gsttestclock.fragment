fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "libgstcheck-1.0/c/gsttestclock.html#gsttestclock", "fragment": "GstTestClock \nGstTestClock is an implementation of GstClock which has different behaviour compared to GstSystemClock. Time for GstSystemClock advances according to the system time while time for GstTestClock changes only when gst_test_clock_set_time or gst_test_clock_advance_time are called. GstTestClock provides unit tests with the possibility to precisely advance the time in a deterministic manner independent of the system time or any other external factors. \n"});
