Implemented via buffer probes. This function will block until the pipeline passes a buffer over pad so for robust behavior in unit tests you need to use check s timeout to fail out in the case that a buffer never arrives. \nYou must have previously called GstCheck.prototype.buffer_straw_start_pipeline on pipeline and pad. \nParameters \nthe pipeline previously started via GstCheck.prototype.buffer_straw_start_pipeline \nthe pad previously passed to GstCheck.prototype.buffer_straw_start_pipeline \nthe captured Gst.Buffer. \n"});
