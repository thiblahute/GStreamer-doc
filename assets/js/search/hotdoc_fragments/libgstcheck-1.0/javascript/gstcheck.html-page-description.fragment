The element should create one buffer and this will be compared with buffer_out. We only check the caps and the data of the buffers. This function unrefs the buffers. \nCreate an element using the factory providing the element_name and push the buffers in buffer_in to this element. The element should create the buffers equal to the buffers in buffer_out. We only check the size and the data of the buffers. This function unrefs the buffers in the two lists. The last_flow_return parameter indicates the expected flow return value from pushing the final buffer in the list. This can be used to set up a test which pushes some buffers and then an invalid buffer when the final buffer is expected to fail for example. \nUnrefs object_to_unref and checks that is has properly been destroyed. \nRemove a filter that has been added by gst_check_add_log_filter. \nMT safe. \nsetup an element for a filter test with mysrcpad and mysinkpad \nPush stream start caps and segment event which consist of the minimum required events to allow streaming. Caps is optional to allow raw src testing. If element has more than one src or sink pad use GstCheck.prototype.check_setup_events_with_stream_id instead. \nPush stream start caps and segment event which consist of the minimum required events to allow streaming. Caps is optional to allow raw src testing. \nDoes the same as GstCheck.prototype.check_setup_sink_pad_by_name with the name parameter equal to src \nCreates a new sink pad based on the given tmpl and links it to the given element src pad the pad that matches the given name You can set event chain query functions on this pad to check the output of the element. \nDoes the same as GstCheck.prototype.check_setup_src_pad_by_name with the name parameter equal to sink \nCreates a new src pad based on the given tmpl and links it to the given element sink pad the pad that matches the given name Before using the src pad to push data on element you need to call GstCheck.prototype.check_setup_events on the created src pad. \nExample of how to push a buffer on element \nFor very simple input output test scenarios checkout GstCheck.prototype.check_element_push_buffer_list and GstCheck.prototype.check_element_push_buffer. \n"});
