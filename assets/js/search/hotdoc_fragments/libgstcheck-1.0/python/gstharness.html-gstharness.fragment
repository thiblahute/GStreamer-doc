It can be thought of as a way of treating a Gst.Element as a black box deterministically feeding it data and controlling what data it outputs. \nThe basic structure of GstCheck.Harness is two floating Gst.Pad that connect to the harnessed Gst.Element src and sink Gst.Pad like so \n\nWith this you can now simulate any environment the Gst.Element might find itself in. By specifying the Gst.Caps of the harness Gst.Pad using functions like GstCheck.Harness.set_src_caps or GstCheck.Harness.set_sink_caps_str you can test how the Gst.Element interacts with different caps sets. \nYour harnessed Gst.Element can of course also be a bin and using gst_harness_new_parse not introspectable supporting standard gst launch syntax you can easily test a whole pipeline instead of just one element. \nYou can then go on to push Gst.Buffer and Gst.Event on to the srcpad using functions like GstCheck.Harness.push and GstCheck.Harness.push_event and then pull them out to examine them with GstCheck.Harness.pull and GstCheck.Harness.pull_event. \n"});
