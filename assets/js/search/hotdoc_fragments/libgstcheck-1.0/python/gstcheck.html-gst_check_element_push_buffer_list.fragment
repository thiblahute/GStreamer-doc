The element should create the buffers equal to the buffers in buffer_out. We only check the size and the data of the buffers. This function unrefs the buffers in the two lists. The last_flow_return parameter indicates the expected flow return value from pushing the final buffer in the list. This can be used to set up a test which pushes some buffers and then an invalid buffer when the final buffer is expected to fail for example. \n"});
