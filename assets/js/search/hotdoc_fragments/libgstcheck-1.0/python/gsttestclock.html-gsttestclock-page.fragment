Time for Gst.SystemClock advances according to the system time while time for GstCheck.TestClock changes only when GstCheck.TestClock.set_time or GstCheck.TestClock.advance_time are called. GstCheck.TestClock provides unit tests with the possibility to precisely advance the time in a deterministic manner independent of the system time or any other external factors. \n"});
