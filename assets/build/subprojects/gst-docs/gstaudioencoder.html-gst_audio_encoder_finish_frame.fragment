Source pad caps must be set when this is called. \nIf samples then best estimate is all samples provided to encoder subclass so far. buf may be NULL in which case next number of samples are considered discarded e.g. as a result of discontinuous transmission and a discontinuity is marked. \nNote that samples received in gst_audio_encoder_handle_frame may be invalidated by a call to this function. \n"});
