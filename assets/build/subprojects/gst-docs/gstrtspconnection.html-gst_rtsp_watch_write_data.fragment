If it cannot be sent immediately it will be queued for transmission in watch. The contents of message will then be serialized and transmitted when the connection of the watch becomes writable. In case the message is queued the ID returned in id will be non zero and used as the ID argument in the message_sent callback. \nThis function will take ownership of data and g_free it after use. \nIf the amount of queued data exceeds the limits set with GstRtsp.RTSPWatch.prototype.set_send_backlog this function will return GstRtsp.RTSPResult.prototype.enomem. \n"});
