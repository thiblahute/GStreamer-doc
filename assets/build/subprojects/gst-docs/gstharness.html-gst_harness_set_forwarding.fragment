It will also forward the Gst.QueryType.prototype.allocation. \nIf forwarding is disabled the user will have to either manually push these events from the src harness using GstCheck.Harness.prototype.src_push_event or create and push them manually. While this will allow full control and inspection of these events for the most cases having forwarding enabled will be sufficient when writing a test where the src harness main function is providing data for the main harness. \nForwarding is enabled by default. \nMT safe. \n"});
