fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "../../../build/subprojects/gst-docs/gstdiscoverer.html#GstDiscoverer", "fragment": "The GstPbutils.Discoverer is a utility object which allows to get as much information as possible from one or many URIs. \nIt provides two APIs allowing usage in blocking or non blocking mode. \nThe blocking mode just requires calling GstPbutils.Discoverer.prototype.discover_uri with the URI one wishes to discover. \nThe non blocking mode requires a running GLib.MainLoop iterating a GLib.MainContext where one connects to the various signals appends the URIs to be processed through GstPbutils.Discoverer.prototype.discover_uri_async and then asks for the discovery to begin through GstPbutils.Discoverer.prototype.start By default this will use the GLib default main context unless you have set a custom context using g_main_context_push_thread_default. \nAll the information is returned in a GstPbutils.DiscovererInfo structure. \n"});
