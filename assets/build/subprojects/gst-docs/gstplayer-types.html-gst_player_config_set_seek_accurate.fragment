When enabled elements will try harder to seek as accurately as possible to the requested seek position. Generally it will be slower especially for formats that don t have any indexes or timestamp markers in the stream. \nIf accurate seeking is disabled elements will seek as close as the request position without slowing down seeking too much. \nAccurate seeking is disabled by default. \n"});
