This is usually less than the segment size but can be bigger when the implementation uses another internal buffer between the audio device. \nFor playback ringbuffers this is the amount of samples transfered from the ringbuffer to the device but still not played. \nFor capture ringbuffers this is the amount of samples in the device that are not yet transfered to the ringbuffer. \n"});
