<p>This document describes the events and objects involved in stream
selection in GStreamer pipelines, elements and applications</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>This new API is intended to address the use cases described in
this section:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a user/app I want an overview and control of the media streams
that can be configured within a pipeline for processing, even
when some streams are mutually exclusive or logical constructs only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user/app can disable entirely streams it's not interested
in so they don't occupy memory or processing power - discarded
as early as possible in the pipeline. The user/app can also
(re-)enable them at a later time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the set of possible stream configurations is changing,
the user/app should be aware of the pending change and
be able to make configuration choices for the new set of streams,
as well as possibly still reconfiguring the old set</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elements that have some other internal mechanism for triggering
stream selections (DVD, or maybe some scripted playback
playlist) should be able to trigger 'selection' of some particular
stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicate known relationships between streams - for example that
2 separate video feeds represent the 2 views of a stereoscopic
view, or that certain streams are mutually exclusive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the streams that are "available" are not automatically
the ones active, or present in the pipeline as pads. Think HLS/DASH
alternate streams.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="example-use-cases">Example use cases</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Playing an MPEG-TS multi-program stream, we want to tell the
app that there are multiple programs that could be extracted
from the incoming feed. Further, we want to provide a mechanism
for the app to select which program(s) to decode, and once
that is known to further tell the app which elementary streams
are then available within those program(s) so the app/user can
choose which audio track(s) to decode and/or use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new PMT arrives for an MPEG-TS stream, due to a codec or
channel change. The pipeline will need to reconfigure to
play the desired streams from new program. Equally, there
may be multiple seconds of content buffered from the old
program and it should still be possible to switch (for example)
subtitle tracks responsively in the draining out data, as
well as selecting which subs track to play from the new feed.
This same scenario applies when doing gapless transition to a
new source file/URL, except that likely the element providing
the list of streams also changes as a new demuxer is installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When playing a multi-angle DVD, the DVD Virtual Machine needs to
extract 1 angle from the data for presentation. It can publish
the available angles as logical streams, even though only one
stream can be chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When playing a DVD, the user can make stream selections from the
DVD menu to choose audio or sub-picture tracks, or the DVD VM
can trigger automatic selections. In addition, the player UI
should be able to show which audio/subtitle tracks are available
and allow direct selection in a GUI the same as for normal
files with subtitle tracks in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playing a SCHC (3DTV) feed, where one view is MPEG-2 and the other
is H.264 and they should be combined for 3D presentation, or
not bother decoding 1 stream if displaying 2D.
(bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=719333)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>FIXME - need some use cases indicating what alternate streams in
HLS might require - what are the possibilities?</p>
<h2 id="design-overview">Design Overview</h2>
<p>Stream selection in GStreamer is implemented in several parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Objects describing streams : <code>GstStream</code></li>
<li>Objects describing a collection of streams : <code>GstStreamCollection</code></li>
<li>Events from the app allowing selection and activation of some streams:
<code>GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS</code></li>
<li>Messages informing the user/application about the available
streams and current status: <code>GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION</code> and
<code>GST_MESSAGE_STREAMS_SELECTED</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="gststream-objects">GstStream objects</h2>
<pre><code>API:

GstStream
gst_stream_new(..)
gst_stream_get_\*(...)
gst_stream_set_\*()
gst_event_set_stream(...)
gst_event_parse_stream(...)
</code></pre>
<p><code>GstStream</code> objects are a high-level convenience object containing
information regarding a possible data stream that can be exposed by
GStreamer elements.</p>
<p>They are mostly the aggregation of information present in other
GStreamer components (<code>STREAM_START</code>, <code>CAPS</code>, <code>TAGS</code> events) but are not
tied to the presence of a <code>GstPad</code>, and for some use-cases provide
information that the existing components don't provide.</p>
<p>The various properties of a <code>GstStream</code> object are:</p>
<ul>
<li>stream_id (from the <code>STREAM_START</code> event)</li>
<li>flags (from the <code>STREAM_START</code> event)</li>
<li>caps</li>
<li>tags</li>
<li>type (high-level type of stream: Audio, Video, Container,...)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>GstStream</code> objects can be subclassed so that they can be re-used by
elements already using the notion of stream (which is common for
example in demuxers).</p>
<p>Elements that create GstStream should also set it on the
<code>GST_EVENT_STREAM_START</code> event of the relevant pad. This helps
downstream elements to have all information in one location.</p>
<h2 id="exposing-collections-of-streams">Exposing collections of streams</h2>
<pre><code>API:

GstStreamCollection
gst_stream_collection_new(...)
gst_stream_collection_add_stream(...)
gst_stream_collection_get_size(...)
gst_stream_collection_get_stream(...)
GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION
gst_message_new_stream_collection(...)
gst_message_parse_stream_collection(...)
GST_EVENT_STREAM_COLLECTION
gst_event_new_stream_collection(...)
gst_event_parse_stream_collection(...)
</code></pre>
<p>Elements that create new streams (such as demuxers) or can create
new streams (like the HLS/DASH alternative streams) can list the
streams they can make available with the GstStreamCollection object.</p>
<p>Other elements that might generate <code>GstStreamCollections</code> are the
DVD-VM, which handles internal switching of tracks, or parsebin and
decodebin3 when it aggregates and presents multiple internal stream
sources as a single configurable collection.</p>
<p>The <code>GstStreamCollection</code> object is a flat listing of <code>GstStream</code> objects.</p>
<p>The various properties of a <code>GstStreamCollection</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>'identifier'
<ul>
<li>the identifier of the collection (unique name)</li>
<li>Generated from the 'upstream stream id' (or stream ids, plural)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the list of <code>GstStreams</code> in the collection.</li>
<li>(Not implemented) : Flags -
For now, the only flag is <code>INFORMATIONAL</code> - used by container parsers to
publish information about detected streams without allowing selection of
the streams.</li>
<li>(Not implemented yet) : The relationship between the various streams
This specifies which streams are exclusive (can not be selected at the
same time), are related (such as <code>LINKED_VIEW</code> or <code>ENHANCEMENT</code>), or need to
be selected together.</li>
</ul>
<p>An element will inform outside components about that collection via:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION</code> message on the bus.</li>
<li>a <code>GST_EVENT_STREAM_COLLECTION</code> on each source pads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications and container bin elements can listen and collect the
various stream collections to know the full range of streams
available within a bin/pipeline.</p>
<p>Once posted on the bus, a <code>GstStreamCollection</code> is immutable. It is
updated by subsequent messages with a matching identifier.</p>
<p>If the element that provided the collection goes away, there is no way
to know that the streams are no longer valid (without having the
user/app track that element). The exception to that is if the bin
containing that element (such as parsebin or decodebin3) informs that
the next collection is a replacement of the former one.</p>
<p>The mutual exclusion and relationship lists use stream-ids
rather than <code>GstStream</code> references in order to avoid circular
referencing problems.</p>
<h3 id="usage-from-elements">Usage from elements</h3>
<p>When a demuxer knows the list of streams it can expose, it
creates a new GstStream for each stream it can provide with the
appropriate information (stream id, flag, tags, caps, ...).</p>
<p>The demuxer then creates a GstStreamCollection object in which it
will put the list of GstStream it can expose.  That collection is
then both posted on the bus (via a <code>GST_MESSAGE_COLLECTION</code>) and on
each pad (via a <code>GST_EVENT_STREAM_COLLECTION</code>).</p>
<p>That new collection must be posted on the bus <em>before</em> the changes
are made available. i.e. before pads corresponding to that selection
are added/removed.</p>
<p>In order to be backwards-compatible and support elements that don't
create streams/collection yet, the new 'parsebin' element used by
decodebin3 will automatically create those if not provided.</p>
<h3 id="usage-from-application">Usage from application</h3>
<p>Applications can know what streams are available by listening to the
<code>GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION</code> messages posted on the bus.</p>
<p>The application can list the available streams per-type (such as all
the audio streams, or all the video streams) by iterating the
streams available in the collection by <code>GST_STREAM_TYPE</code>.</p>
<p>The application will also be able to use these stream information to
decide which streams should be activated or not (see the stream
selection event below).</p>
<h3 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h3>
<p>Not all demuxers will create the various <code>GstStream</code> and
<code>GstStreamCollection</code> objects. In order to remain backwards
compatible, a parent bin (parsebin in decodebin3) will create the
<code>GstStream</code> and <code>GstStreamCollection</code> based on the pads being
added/removed from an element.</p>
<p>This allows providing stream listing/selection for any demuxer-like
element even if it doesn't implement the <code>GstStreamCollection</code> usage.</p>
<h2 id="stream-selection-event">Stream selection event</h2>
<pre><code>API:

GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS
gst_event_new_select_streams(...)
gst_event_parse_select_streams(...)
</code></pre>
<p>Stream selection events are generated by the application and sent into the
pipeline to configure the streams.</p>
<p>The event carries:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of <code>GstStreams</code> to activate - a subset of the <code>GstStreamCollection</code></li>
<li>(Not implemented) - List of <code>GstStreams</code> to be kept discarded - a
subset of streams for which hot-swapping will not be desired,
allowing elements (such as decodebin3, demuxers, ...) to not parse or
buffer those streams at all.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage-from-application1">Usage from application</h3>
<p>There are two use-cases where an application needs to specify in a
generic fashion which streams it wants in output:</p>
<ol>
<li>When there are several present streams of which it only wants a
subset (such as one audio, one video and one subtitle
stream). Those streams are demuxed and present in the pipeline.</li>
<li>When the stream the user wants require some element to undertake
some action to expose that stream in the pipeline (such as
DASH/HLS alternative streams).</li>
</ol>
<p>From the point of view of the application, those two use-cases are
treated identically.  The streams are all available through the
<code>GstStreamCollection</code> posted on the bus, and it will select a subset.</p>
<p>The application can select the streams it wants by creating a
<code>GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS</code> event with the list of stream-id of the
streams it wants. That event is then sent on the pipeline,
eventually traveling all the way upstream from each sink.</p>
<p>In some cases, selecting one stream may trigger the availability of
other dependent streams, resulting in new <code>GstStreamCollection</code>
messages. This can happen in the case where choosing a different DVB
channel would create a new single-program collection.</p>
<h3 id="usage-in-elements">Usage in elements</h3>
<p>Elements that receive the <code>GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS</code> event and that
can activate/deactivate streams need to look at the list of
stream-id contained in the event and decide if they need to do some
action.</p>
<p>In the standard demuxer case (demuxing and exposing all streams),
there is nothing to do by default.</p>
<p>In decodebin3, activating or deactivating streams is taken care of by
linking only the streams present in the event to decoders and output
ghostpad.</p>
<p>In the case of elements that can expose alternate streams that are
not present in the pipeline as pads, they will take the appropriate
action to add/remove those streams.</p>
<p>Containers that receive the event should pass it to any elements
with no downstream peers, so that streams can be configured during
pre-roll before a pipeline is completely linked down to sinks.</p>
<h2 id="decodebin3-usage-and-example">decodebin3 usage and example</h2>
<p>This is an example of how decodebin3 works by using the
above-mentioned objects/events/messages.</p>
<p>For clarity/completeness, we will consider a mpeg-ts stream that has
multiple audio streams. Furthermore that stream might have changes
at some point (switching video codec, or adding/removing audio
streams).</p>
<h3 id="initial-differences">Initial differences</h3>
<p>decodebin3 is different, compared to decodebin2, in the sense that, by
default:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will only expose as output ghost source pads one stream of each
type (one audio, one video, ..).</li>
<li>It will only decode the exposed streams</li>
</ul>
<p>The multiqueue element is still used and takes in all elementary
(non-decoded) streams. If parsers are needed/present they are placed
before the multiqueue. This is needed in order for multiqueue to
work only with packetized and properly timestamped streams.</p>
<p>Note that the whole typefinding of streams, and optional depayloading,
demuxing and parsing are done in a new 'parsebin' element.</p>
<p>Just like the current implementation, demuxers will expose all
streams present within a program as source pads. They will connect
to parsers and multiqueue.</p>
<p>Initial setup. 1 video stream, 2 audio streams.</p>
<pre><code>  +---------------------+
  | parsebin            |
  | ---------           | +-------------+
  | | demux |--[parser]-+-| multiqueue  |--[videodec]---[
]-+-|       |--[parser]-+-|             |

  | ---------           | +-------------+
  +---------------------+
</code></pre>
<h3 id="gststreamcollection">GstStreamCollection</h3>
<p>When parsing the initial PAT/PMT, the demuxer will:</p>
<ol>
<li>create the various GstStream objects for each stream.</li>
<li>create the GstStreamCollection for that initial PMT</li>
<li>post the <code>GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION</code> Decodebin will intercept that
message and know what the demuxer will be exposing.</li>
<li>The demuxer creates the various pads and sends the corresponding
<code>STREAM_START</code> event (with the same stream-id as the corresponding
<code>GstStream</code> objects), <code>CAPS</code> event, and <code>TAGS</code> event.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>parsebin will add all relevant parsers and expose those streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decodebin will be able to correlate, based on <code>STREAM_START</code> event
stream-id, what pad corresponds to which stream. It links each stream
from parsebin to multiqueue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decodebin knows all the streams that will be available. Since by
default it is configured to only expose a stream of each type, it
will pick a stream of each for which it will complete the
auto-plugging (finding a decoder and then exposing that stream as a
source ghostpad.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If the demuxer doesn't create/post the <code>GstStreamCollection</code>,
parsebin will create it on itself, as explained in section 2.3
above.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="changing-the-active-selection-from-the-application">Changing the active selection from the application</h3>
<p>The user wants to change the audio track. The application received
the <code>GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION</code> containing the list of available
streams. For clarity, we will assume those stream-ids are
"video-main", "audio-english" and "audio-french".</p>
<p>The user prefers to use the french soundtrack (which it knows based
on the language tag contained in the <code>GstStream</code> objects).</p>
<p>The application will create and send a <code>GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAM</code> event
containing the list of streams: "video-main", "audio-french".</p>
<p>That event gets sent on the pipeline, the sinks send it upstream and
eventually reach decodebin.</p>
<p>Decodebin compares:</p>
<ul>
<li>The currently active selection ("video-main", "audio-english")</li>
<li>The available stream collection ("video-main", "audio-english",
"audio-french")</li>
<li>The list of streams in the event ("video-main", "audio-french")</li>
</ul>
<p>Decodebin determines that no change is required for "video-main",
but sees that it needs to deactivate "audio-english" and activate
"audio-french".</p>
<p>It unlinks the multiqueue source pad connected to the audiodec. Then
it queries audiodec, using the <code>GST_QUERY_ACCEPT_CAPS</code>, whether it can
accept as-is the caps from the "audio-french" stream.</p>
<ol>
<li>If it does, the multiqueue source pad corresponding to
"audio-french" is linked to the decoder.</li>
<li>If it does not, the existing audio decoder is removed,
a new decoder is selected (like during initial
auto-plugging), and replaces the old audio decoder element.</li>
</ol>
<p>The newly selected stream gets decoded and output through the same
pad as the previous audio stream.</p>
<p>Note:
The default behaviour would be to only expose one stream of each
type. But nothing prevents decodebin from outputting more/less of
each type if the <code>GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAM</code> event specifies that. This
allows covering more use-case than the simple playback one.
Such examples could be :</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanting just a video stream or just an audio stream</li>
<li>Wanting all decoded streams</li>
<li>Wanting all audio streams
...</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-coming-from-upstream">Changes coming from upstream</h3>
<p>At some point in time, a PMT change happens. Let's assume a change
in video-codec and/or PID.</p>
<p>The demuxer creates a new <code>GstStream</code> for the changed/new stream,
creates a new GstStreamCollection for the updated PMT and posts it.</p>
<p>Decodebin sees the new <code>GstStreamCollection</code> message.</p>
<p>The demuxer (and parsebin) then adds and removes pads.</p>
<ol>
<li>decodebin will match the new pads to <code>GstStream</code> in the "new"
<code>GstStreamCollection</code> the same way it did for the initial pads in
section 4.2 above.</li>
<li>decodebin will see whether the new stream can re-use a multiqueue
slot used by a stream of the same type no longer present (it
compares the old collection to the new collection).
In this case, decodebin sees that the new video stream can re-use
the same slot as the previous video stream.</li>
<li>If the new stream is going to be active by default (in this case
it does because we are replacing the only video stream, which was
active), it will check whether the caps are compatible with the
existing videodec (in the same way it was done for the audio
decoder switch in section 4.3).</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually, the stream that switched will be decoded and output
through the same pad as the previous video stream in a gapless fashion.</p>
<h3 id="further-examples">Further examples</h3>
<h5 id="hls-alternates">HLS alternates</h5>
<p>There is a main (multi-bitrate or not) stream with audio and
video interleaved in mpeg-ts. The manifest also indicates the
presence of alternate language audio-only streams.
HLS would expose one collection containing:</p>
<ol>
<li>The main A+V CONTAINER stream (mpeg-ts), initially active,
downloaded and exposed as a pad</li>
<li>The alternate A-only streams, initially inactive and not exposed as pads
the tsdemux element connected to the first stream will also expose
a collection containing
1.1) A video stream
1.2) An audio stream</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>    [ Collection 1 ]         [ Collection 2 ]
    [  (hlsdemux)  ]         [   (tsdemux)  ]
    [ upstream:nil ]    /----[ upstream:main]
    [              ]   /     [              ]
    [ "main" (A+V) ]&lt;-/      [ "video"  (V) ]  viddec1 : "video"
    [ "fre"  (A)   ]         [ "eng"    (A) ]  auddec1 : "eng"
    [ "kor"  (A)   ]         [              ]
</code></pre>
<p>The user might want to use the korean audio track instead of the
default english one.</p>
<pre><code>  =&gt; SELECT_STREAMS ("video", "kor")
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>decodebin3 receives and sends the event further upstream</li>
<li>tsdemux sees that "video" is part of its current upstream,
so adds the corresponding stream-id ("main") to the event
and sends it upstream ("main", "video", "kor")</li>
<li>hlsdemux receives the event
=&gt; It activates "kor" in addition to "main"</li>
<li>The event travels back to decodebin3 which will remember the
requested selection. If "kor" is already present it will switch
the "eng" stream from the audio decoder to the "kor" stream.
If it appears a bit later, it will wait until that "kor" stream
is available before switching</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="multiprogram-mpegts">multi-program MPEG-TS</h4>
<p>Assuming the case of a mpeg-ts stream which contains multiple
programs.
There would be three "levels" of collection:</p>
<ol>
<li>The collection of programs presents in the stream</li>
<li>The collection of elementary streams presents in a stream</li>
<li>The collection of streams decodebin can expose</li>
</ol>
<p>Initially tsdemux exposes the first program present (default)</p>
<pre><code>    [ Collection 1 ]         [ Collection 2     ]        [ Collection 3    ]

</code></pre>
<p>At some point the user wants to switch to ITV (of which we do not
know the topology at this point in time. A <code>SELECT_STREAMS</code> event
is sent with "ITV" in it and the pointer to the Collection1.</p>
<ol>
<li>The event travels up the pipeline until tsdemux receives it
and begins the switch.</li>
<li>tsdemux publishes a new 'Collection 2a/ITV' and marks 'Collection 2/BBC'
as replaced.
2a) App may send a <code>SELECT_STREAMS</code> event configuring which demuxer output
streams should be selected (parsed)</li>
<li>tsdemux adds/removes pads as needed (flushing pads as it removes them?)</li>
<li>Decodebin feeds new pad streams through existing parsers/decoders as
needed. As data from the new collection arrives out each decoder,
decodebin sends new <code>GstStreamCollection</code> messages to the app so it
can know that the new streams are now switchable at that level.
4a) As new <code>GstStreamCollections</code> are published, the app may override
the default decodebin stream selection to expose more/fewer streams.
The default is to decode and output 1 stream of each type.</li>

<h3 id="open-questions">OPEN QUESTIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is a <code>FLUSHING</code> flag for stream-selection required or not ? This would
make the handler of the <code>SELECT_STREAMS</code> event send <code>FLUSH START/STOP</code>
before switching to the other streams. This is tricky when dealing
where situations where we keep some streams and only switch some
others. Do we flush all streams ? Do we only flush the new streams,
potentially resulting in delay to fully switch ? Furthermore, due to
efficient buffering in decodebin3, the switching time has been
minimized extensively, to the point where flushing might not bring a
noticeable improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store the stream collection in bins/pipelines ? A Bin/Pipeline could
store all active collection internally, so that it could be queried
later on. This could be useful to then get, on any pipeline, at any
point in time, the full list of collections available without having
to listen to all COLLECTION messages on the bus. This would require
fixing the "is a collection a replacement or not" issue first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When switching to new collections, should decodebin3 make any effort
to <em>map</em> corresponding streams from the old to new PMT - that is,
try and stick to the <em>english</em> language audio track, for example?
Alternatively, rely on the app to do such smarts with stream-select
messages ?</p>
</li>
