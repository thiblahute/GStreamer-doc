<h1 id="porting-010-applications-to-10">Porting 0.10 applications to 1.0</h1>
<p>This section outlines some of the changes necessary to port applications
from GStreamer-0.10 to GStreamer-1.0. For a comprehensive and up-to-date
list, see the separate <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/plain/docs/random/porting-to-1.0.txt">Porting
to 1.0</a>
document.</p>
<p>It should be possible to port simple applications to GStreamer-1.0 in
less than a day.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-changes">List of changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All deprecated methods were removed. Recompile against 0.10 with
GST_DISABLE_DEPRECATED defined (such as by adding
-DGST_DISABLE_DEPRECATED to the compiler flags) and fix issues
before attempting to port to 1.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"playbin2" has been renamed to "playbin", with similar API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"decodebin2" has been renamed to "decodebin", with similar API. Note
that there is no longer a "new-decoded-pad" signal, just use
GstElement's "pad-added" signal instead (but don't forget to remove
the 'gboolean last' argument from your old signal callback functino
signature).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the names of some "formatted" pad templates has been changed from
e.g. "src%d" to "src%u" or "src_%u" or similar, since we don't want
to see negative numbers in pad names. This mostly affects
applications that create request pads from elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some elements that used to have a single dynamic source pad have a
source pad now. Example: wavparse, id3demux, iceydemux, apedemux.
(This does not affect applications using decodebin or playbin).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>playbin now proxies the GstVideoOverlay (former GstXOverlay)
interface, so most applications can just remove the sync bus handler
where they would set the window ID, and instead just set the window
ID on playbin from the application thread before starting playback.</p>
<p>playbin also proxies the GstColorBalance and GstNavigation
interfaces, so applications that use this don't need to go fishing
for elements that may implement those any more, but can just use on
playbin unconditionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multifdsink, tcpclientsink, tcpclientsrc, tcpserversrc the protocol
property is removed, use gdppay and gdpdepay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML serialization was removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probes and pad blocking was merged into new pad probes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Position, duration and convert functions no longer use an inout
parameter for the destination format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video and audio caps were simplified. audio/x-raw-int and
audio/x-raw-float are now all under the audio/x-raw media type.
Similarly, video/x-raw-rgb and video/x-raw-yuv are now video/x-raw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ffmpegcolorspace was removed and replaced with videoconvert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GstMixerInterface / GstTunerInterface were removed without
replacement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GstXOverlay interface was renamed to GstVideoOverlay, and now
part of the video library in gst-plugins-base, as the interfaces
library no longer exists.</p>
<p>The name of the GstXOverlay "prepare-xwindow-id" message has changed
to "prepare-window-handle" (and GstXOverlay has been renamed to
GstVideoOverlay). Code that checks for the string directly should be
changed to use
gst_is_video_overlay_prepare_window_handle_message(message)
instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GstPropertyProbe interface was removed. There is no replacement
for it in GStreamer 1.0.x and 1.2.x, but since version 1.4 there is
a more featureful replacement for device discovery and feature
querying provided by GstDeviceMonitor, GstDevice, and friends. See
the <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-device-probing.html">"GStreamer Device Discovery and Device Probing"
documentation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gst_uri_handler_get_uri() and the get_uri vfunc now return a
copy of the URI string</p>
<p>gst_uri_handler_set_uri() and the set_uri vfunc now take an
additional GError argument so the handler can notify the caller why
it didn't accept a particular URI.</p>
<p>gst_uri_handler_set_uri() now checks if the protocol of the URI
passed is one of the protocols advertised by the uri handler, so
set_uri vfunc implementations no longer need to check that as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GstTagList is now an opaque mini object instead of being typedefed
to a GstStructure. While it was previously okay (and in some cases
required because of missing taglist API) to cast a GstTagList to a
GstStructure or use gst_structure_* API on taglists, you can no
longer do that. Doing so will cause crashes.</p>
<p>Also, tag lists are refcounted now, and can therefore not be freely
modified any longer. Make sure to call
gst_tag_list_make_writable (taglist) before adding, removing or
changing tags in the taglist.</p>
<p>GST_TAG_IMAGE, GST_TAG_PREVIEW_IMAGE, GST_TAG_ATTACHMENT:
many tags that used to be of type GstBuffer are now of type
GstSample (which is basically a struct containing a buffer alongside
caps and some other info).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GstController has now been merged into GstObject. It does not exists
as an individual object anymore. In addition core contains a
GstControlSource base class and the GstControlBinding. The actual
control sources are in the controller library as before. The 2nd big
change is that control sources generate a sequence of gdouble values
and those are mapped to the property type and value range by
GstControlBindings.</p>
<p>The whole gst_controller_* API is gone and now available in
simplified form under gst_object_*. ControlSources are now
attached via GstControlBinding to properties. There are no GValue
arguments used anymore when programming control sources.</p>
</li>
